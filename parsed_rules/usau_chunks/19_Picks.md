## 19. Picks

<!-- section: 19 source: usau -->

### 19.A. A pick occurs whenever an offensive player moves in a manner that causes a defensive
<!-- rule: 19.A source: usau -->

player guarding (3.D) an offensive player to be obstructed by another player. Obstruction may
result from contact with, or the need to avoid, the obstructing player. However, it is not a pick
if both the offensive player being guarded and the obstructing player are making a play on the
disc at the time of the obstruction.
### 19.B. A pick can be called only by the obstructed player and must be announced by loudly calling
<!-- rule: 19.B source: usau -->

“pick” immediately after it occurs.  [[Call the pick immediately. If you wait too long, you lose
your window of opportunity to make the call.]]
### 19.C. If play stops according to 17.C, players reposition according to 17.C.6.  [[So if the disc is
<!-- rule: 19.C source: usau -->

returned to the thrower, everyone resumes the locations they occupied at the earlier of the
time of the throw or the time of the call.]]  In addition, the obstructed player is then allowed to
move to recover the relative position lost because of the pick.  [[If they were trailing by 9 feet,
then they get to catch back up to 9 feet away, but do not get to set up right next to the
offensive player.]]
### 19.D. During any stoppage, opposing players may agree to slightly adjust their locations to avoid

potential imminent picks.
