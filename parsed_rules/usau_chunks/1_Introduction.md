### 1.A. Description: Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven

players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored when a player catches any
legal pass in the end zone that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding the disc.
The disc is advanced by passing it to other players. The disc may be passed in any direction.
Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of the team
in possession of the disc. Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework governed
by the principles of Spirit of the Game.
