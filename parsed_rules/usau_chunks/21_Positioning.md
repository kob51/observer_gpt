## 21. Positioning

<!-- section: 21 source: usau -->

### 21.A. Each player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by an opposing player,
<!-- rule: 21.A source: usau -->

unless specifically overridden elsewhere, provided that no personal contact is caused in taking
such a position.
### 21.B. A player who jumps is entitled to land at the take-off spot without hindrance by opponents. That
<!-- rule: 21.B source: usau -->

player also is entitled to land at another spot, provided that the landing spot, and the direct path
between the take-off and landing spots, were not already occupied at the time of take-off.  [[This
does not trump a player’s responsibility to make reasonable efforts to avoid contact and to not
commit a blocking foul. If you commit a blocking foul, the fact that you jumped to the spot
instead of running does not negate the foul.]]
### 21.C. The defense must not move in a manner that obstructs the offense from taking possession of
<!-- rule: 21.C source: usau -->

the disc or establishing a pivot.
### 21.D. Players may not use their extended arms or legs to obstruct the movement of an opponent.  [[A
<!-- rule: 21.D source: usau -->

player’s arms and legs are not considered “extended” during normal running and jumping.]]
