## Appendix E: Youth Rules Adaptations

<!-- section: Appendix E source: usau -->

The following adaptations to the rules are recommended for youth ultimate competitions, as defined
below. These adaptations may be additions to the current official rules or may supersede existing rules.
Other than these additions and changes, the current official rules will apply to youth competition.
The goals for Youth Rules Adaptations are to modify the game to make it safer, more fun, and more
developmentally appropriate for various age groups. These adaptations should be used with those goals
in mind, rather than for strategic purposes. The current age categories are a general approximation of
development levels, and are also in part based on factors such as school levels and the breakdown of
current age groups participating in the sport. These will continue to be refined in the future.
E1.  Requirements
E1.A.  There are not currently any requirements for rules adaptations for youth under this edition of the
rules. Requirements may come in future editions based on continued research and experience
with adapting the sport for youth age groups.
E2.  Recommendations
E2.A.  These rule adaptations are not required, but are optional recommendations taken in whole or in
part, to help younger players learn to play in a more developmentally appropriate environment.
