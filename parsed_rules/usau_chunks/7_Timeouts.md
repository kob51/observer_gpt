## 7. Timeouts

<!-- section: 7 source: usau -->

### 7.A. A timeout stops play and suspends time limit counts.
<!-- rule: 7.A source: usau -->

### 7.B. Team Timeout: Each team has two team timeouts per half in a standard game.
<!-- rule: 7.B source: usau -->

    - **7.B.1.** A team timeout lasts 70 seconds.
      <!-- rule: 7.B.1 source: usau -->
    - **7.B.2.** Any player, sideline player, or coach may call a timeout after a goal is scored and
      <!-- rule: 7.B.2 source: usau -->
before both teams have signaled readiness to start play. Time limit counts between
points are suspended for 70 seconds and readiness signals are reset. A timeout may
not be called between a re-pull call and the ensuing pull.
    - **7.B.3.** After the pull, only a thrower with possession of the disc that has survived all ground
      <!-- rule: 7.B.3 source: usau -->
contact can call a timeout. The player must form a T with one hand and the disc, and
should audibly say “timeout.” The timeout begins when the T is formed. The disc is
then placed on the ground at the pivot spot.
    - **7.B.4.** Restarting play after a timeout called by a thrower:
      <!-- rule: 7.B.4 source: usau -->
      - **7.B.4.a.** All players at the time of the timeout call must return to play unless an
        <!-- rule: 7.B.4.a source: usau -->
injury timeout also is called.
      - **7.B.4.b.** Each offensive player must establish a stationary position by the end of
        <!-- rule: 7.B.4.b source: usau -->
the timeout. Movement after this time and before the disc is checked into
play is a violation. The defense has ninety seconds after the beginning of
the timeout or up to twenty seconds after all offensive players have
established their positions (whichever is longer) to check the disc into play.
      - **7.B.4.c.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.B.4.c source: usau -->
The player who had possession of the disc when the team timeout was
called restarts play with a check at the pivot spot, and the marker resumes
the stall count with the word “stalling” followed by the last number uttered
before the timeout plus one or 9 if over 8, however 16.E applies.
      - **7.B.4.d.** If the time limits for the timeout are exceeded by one team, a player on the
        <!-- rule: 7.B.4.d source: usau -->
other team may announce “delay of game” and the player at the location
the disc is to be put into play may self-check the disc into play without
acknowledgment by the opposing team. In order to invoke this rule a
player must give warnings of 20, 10, and 5 seconds.
    - **7.B.5.** If the disc is live or in play and the thrower attempts to call a timeout when the team in
      <!-- rule: 7.B.5 source: usau -->
possession has no timeouts remaining, play is stopped. The marker resumes the stall
count with the number last uttered before the call plus three (e.g., if the timeout was
called after a stall count of two, play would resume on a stall count of five). If this
results in a stall count of ten or above, this is a turnover.
### 7.C. Injury Timeout: A timeout called for a player injury. During an injury timeout, the health and
<!-- rule: 7.C source: usau -->

safety of the injured player are of primary concern.
    - **7.C.1.** Any player on the injured player's team may call an injury timeout.
      <!-- rule: 7.C.1 source: usau -->
    - **7.C.2.** The timeout is retroactive to the time of the injury, unless the injured player chooses
      <!-- rule: 7.C.2 source: usau -->
to continue play before the timeout is called, in which case, the timeout begins at the
time of the call. If the disc is in the air or the thrower is in the act of throwing at the
time of the injury or of the call when the player has continued play, the timeout begins
when the play is completed.
      - **7.C.2.a.** The health and safety of the injured player are of primary concern. If a
        <!-- rule: 7.C.2.a source: usau -->
serious injury occurs, other players change their behavior as a result of that
injury, and the captains of both teams agree, the play may be resolved or
play may be restarted in any appropriate manner despite any outcome
dictated by these rules.  [[This could include, for example, returning a
thrown disc to the thrower regardless of the outcome, restarting the point
with a re-pull, or delaying the restart of play.]]
    - **7.C.3.** Restarting play after an injury timeout:
      <!-- rule: 7.C.3 source: usau -->
      - **7.C.3.a.** If a player in possession leaves the field following an injury, the replacing
        <!-- rule: 7.C.3.a source: usau -->
player takes possession.
      - **7.C.3.b.** Play restarts at the appropriate spot with a check and the marker resumes
        <!-- rule: 7.C.3.b source: usau -->
any stall count with the word stalling followed by the last number uttered
before the injury timeout started plus one or 9 if over 8. The substitution of
the thrower or marker does not alter the stall count.
      - **7.C.3.c.** All players must resume their locations on the field at the time the injury
        <!-- rule: 7.C.3.c source: usau -->
timeout began (i.e., players may not set up), unless a team timeout is also
called.
    - **7.C.4.** If the injury was not caused by contact with another player, either the injured player
      <!-- rule: 7.C.4 source: usau -->
must be substituted, or the injured player’s team must forfeit a team timeout by
announcing it prior to restarting play.
    - **7.C.5.** If an injury timeout is called during a team timeout, the opposing team must be
      <!-- rule: 7.C.5 source: usau -->
notified as soon as the injury is discovered (8 .A.2 ).
    - **7.C.6.** If an injury timeout is called between points, all time limits are suspended until the
      <!-- rule: 7.C.6 source: usau -->
injured player is removed from the field.
    - **7.C.7.** Any player, coach, or observer should call an injury timeout for a player who is
      <!-- rule: 7.C.7 source: usau -->
bleeding or has an exposed open wound.
      - **7.C.7.a.** This timeout takes effect when the call is made (i.e., is not retroactive to
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.a source: usau -->
the time of injury). If the disc is in the air or the thrower is in the act of
throwing at the time of the call, the timeout begins when the play is
completed. However, the disc is returned to the thrower if avoiding
potential contact with the bleeding player is determined to have affected
the play.
      - **7.C.7.b.** This timeout may last up to 70 seconds, during which time the injured
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.b source: usau -->
player must have the wound effectively covered in order to return to the
point in progress.
      - **7.C.7.c.** If play cannot be restarted with the injured player’s wound effectively
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.c source: usau -->
covered in 70 seconds, the player’s team may either
        - **7.C.7.c.1.** replace the injured player according to 7.C.3, or
          <!-- rule: 7.C.7.c.1 source: usau -->
        - **7.C.7.c.2.** call a team timeout, if they have one, in order to extend the
          <!-- rule: 7.C.7.c.2 source: usau -->
time frame to have the wound effectively covered and leave
the player in the game.
      - **7.C.7.d.** A bleeding or exposed open wound is “effectively covered” if it is covered
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.d source: usau -->
with a dressing sturdy enough to withstand the demands of activity and
able to prevent bodily fluids from coming in contact with other players.
      - **7.C.7.e.** Any player whose clothing has blood on it must have the affected areas
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.e source: usau -->
disinfected or must change the clothing before returning to play.
      - **7.C.7.f.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.C.7.f source: usau -->
Whether a player may return to play is determined by appropriate medical
staff. If medical staff is not available, captains and coaches may agree that
a wound has been effectively covered and any clothing issues have been
addressed.
### 7.D. Technical Timeout: A technical timeout may be called for illegal equipment, a dangerous
<!-- rule: 7.D source: usau -->

condition, or a broken disc.
    - **7.D.1.** Any player recognizing a condition that endangers themselves or other players may
      <!-- rule: 7.D.1 source: usau -->
call a technical timeout during play by calling “technical.” The thrower may call a
technical timeout during play to replace a cracked, torn, deeply gouged, creased, or
punctured disc; a warped, wet or dirty disc does not qualify. The timeout begins at the
time of the call. If the disc is in the air or the act of throwing at the time of the call, the
timeout begins when the play is completed.
      - **7.D.1.a.** If a player discovers a dangerous condition after the disc is in the air or
        <!-- rule: 7.D.1.a source: usau -->
while the thrower is in the act of throwing and the player ceases play as a
result, the disc is returned to the thrower regardless of the outcome of that
pass. However, if both teams agree that ceasing play did not affect the
outcome of the throw, the result of the play stands.  [[For example, a
receiver is not required to continue playing through a dangerous situation,
such as a child wandering onto the field. In that case, the receiver should
stop making a play on the disc in order to prioritize the safety of
themselves and others, and the disc will be returned to the thrower once
the dangerous situation is rectified.]]
        - **7.D.1.a.1.** If possession reverts to the thrower, all players return to the
          <!-- rule: 7.D.1.a.1 source: usau -->
locations they occupied at the time of the throw.
    - **7.D.2.** Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to correct faulty equipment (e.g., to
      <!-- rule: 7.D.2 source: usau -->
tie shoelaces or straighten a disc), but active play may not be stopped for this
purpose. (Note: play does not stop during a turnover even if the disc is
out-of-bounds.)
    - **7.D.3.** A player unable to correct illegal equipment in a timely manner must be substituted in
      <!-- rule: 7.D.3 source: usau -->
accordance with 8.A.2.
    - **7.D.4.** Restarting play after a technical timeout:
      <!-- rule: 7.D.4 source: usau -->
      - **7.D.4.a.** The thrower restarts play at the appropriate spot with a check and the
        <!-- rule: 7.D.4.a source: usau -->
marker resumes any stall count as follows:
        - **7.D.4.a.1.** If the technical timeout was called during a stoppage of play,
          <!-- rule: 7.D.4.a.1 source: usau -->
the count resumes at the appropriate count for the event
that stopped play.
        - **7.D.4.a.2.** If the technical timeout stopped play, the count resumes at
          <!-- rule: 7.D.4.a.2 source: usau -->
the stall count reached plus one, or at six if over five.
      - **7.D.4.b.** If a player in possession leaves the field due to illegal equipment, the
        <!-- rule: 7.D.4.b source: usau -->
replacing player puts the disc into play. The substitution of the thrower or
marker does not alter the stall count.
      - **7.D.4.c.** All players must resume their locations on the field at the time the timeout
        <!-- rule: 7.D.4.c source: usau -->
began (i.e., players may not set up), unless a team timeout is also called.
### 7.E. Spirit timeout: A spirit timeout may be called by one or both teams’ spirit captain(s) if they
<!-- rule: 7.E source: usau -->

believe that either or both teams have failed to follow the Spirit of the Game, and (1) game play
has become dangerous; or (2) repeated Spirit of the Game violations are causing conflict
between the teams. Spirit timeouts are subject to the following provisions:
    - **7.E.1.** A spirit timeout can be called only if all of the following conditions have been met:
      <!-- rule: 7.E.1 source: usau -->
      - **7.E.1.a.** Both spirit captains have discussed the perceived Spirit of the Game
        <!-- rule: 7.E.1.a source: usau -->
violation(s) and adjustments to address those violations, and one or more
members of either or both teams have not adjusted their conduct.
      - **7.E.1.b.** Both spirit captains have discussed the need to call a spirit timeout before
        <!-- rule: 7.E.1.b source: usau -->
calling the spirit timeout. It is not required that both spirit captains agree
that a spirit timeout is necessary.
      - **7.E.1.c.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.E.1.c source: usau -->
Play is stopped.
      - **7.E.1.d.** In games with observers, spirit timeouts initiated by the spirit captains
        <!-- rule: 7.E.1.d source: usau -->
must be communicated to the observers before being called. Observers
may call a spirit timeout if the observer believes it is needed and at least
one of the spirit captains agrees.
    - **7.E.2.** During the spirit timeout:
      <!-- rule: 7.E.2 source: usau -->
      - **7.E.2.a.** Both teams will aim to complete all discussions within 5 minutes, with a
        <!-- rule: 7.E.2.a source: usau -->
goal of resuming play as quickly as possible. If teams require more time to
resolve spirit discussions, the timeout can be extended with the consent of
both spirit captains.
      - **7.E.2.b.** Team members may not engage in tactical discussions. Team members
        <!-- rule: 7.E.2.b source: usau -->
may not extend the spirit timeout to try to gain a tactical advantage.
      - **7.E.2.c.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.E.2.c source: usau -->
Spirit timeouts may follow one of two formats, as determined by the spirit
captains. Where the spirit captains disagree as to the format of the spirit
timeout, the default format is for teams to form one circle.
        - **7.E.2.c.1.** All team members of both teams will form one circle,
          <!-- rule: 7.E.2.c.1 source: usau -->
alternating players from each team, if possible. The spirit
captains will lead a conversation addressing and proposing
solutions to resolve spirit issues; or
        - **7.E.2.c.2.** Two circles will be formed, one for each team to internally
          <!-- rule: 7.E.2.c.2 source: usau -->
resolve spirit issues that have already been discussed
between the spirit captains of the opposing team.
    - **7.E.3.** After the spirit timeout:
      <!-- rule: 7.E.3 source: usau -->
      - **7.E.3.a.** The game resumes in the same manner as it does after a team timeout.
        <!-- rule: 7.E.3.a source: usau -->
      - **7.E.3.b.** Spirit timeouts do not affect timeouts available.
        <!-- rule: 7.E.3.b source: usau -->
      - **7.E.3.c.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.E.3.c source: usau -->
For spirit timeouts lasting five minutes or less, the time taken for a spirit
timeout will automatically be added to the length of the game time to
determine time caps for the game. After the initial five minutes, although
spirit captains may always agree to extend a spirit timeout, event
organizers may limit the time that can be added to the length of games.
The spirit captain(s) initiating the spirit timeout will convey the start and
end of the stoppage to event support staff or the event organizer for
time-keeping purposes.
### 7.F. 
<!-- rule: 7.F source: usau -->

Injury, technical, and spirit timeouts are meant to be used exclusively to address the issue for
which the timeout was called. Only personnel needed to address the issue should be on the field
and only for that purpose. Teams may not use these timeouts as team timeouts, unless they
also call a team timeout.
