## 4. Playing Field

<!-- section: 4 source: usau -->

### 4.A. The playing field is a rectangular area and should be essentially flat, free of obstructions and
<!-- rule: 4.A source: usau -->

afford reasonable player safety. Well trimmed grass is the recommended surface and all lines
should be marked.
    - **4.A.1.** Grass and items on the ground are considered part of the ground.
      <!-- rule: 4.A.1 source: usau -->
### 4.B. The standard field of play has dimensions as shown on the accompanying diagram (see
<!-- rule: 4.B source: usau -->

Appendix A).
### 4.C. The playing field is bounded by four perimeter lines: two (2) sidelines along the length and two
<!-- rule: 4.C source: usau -->

(2) backlines along the width. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.
### 4.D. The playing field also includes two (2) goal lines parallel to the backlines. The two (2) areas
<!-- rule: 4.D source: usau -->

bounded by each backline, the sidelines, and the nearest goal line are the end zones.
### 4.E. The central zone is the playing field excluding the end zones.
<!-- rule: 4.E source: usau -->

### 4.F. 
<!-- rule: 4.F source: usau -->

The goal lines separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central zone.
### 4.G. Brick marks are located in the central zone a set distance from each goal line and midway
<!-- rule: 4.G source: usau -->

between the sidelines. Reverse brick marks are located in each end zone midway between the
goal line and backline and midway between the sidelines. A midfield mark is located midway
between the goal lines and midway between the sidelines.
### 4.H. The corners of the central zone and the end zones are marked by brightly colored, flexible
<!-- rule: 4.H source: usau -->

cones or pylons.
### 4.I. 
<!-- rule: 4.I source: usau -->

It is recommended that the following additional lines are also established.
    - **4.I.1.** The equipment line surrounds the playing field. Spectators and gear should remain
      <!-- rule: 4.I.1 source: usau -->
behind this line to keep the perimeter safe and clear during play.
    - **4.I.2.** The team lines are outside of the playing field, parallel to the sidelines. Competitors
      <!-- rule: 4.I.2 source: usau -->
and coaches should remain behind these lines to allow play adjacent to the playing
field.
### 4.J. 
<!-- rule: 4.J source: usau -->

If play is obstructed by sideline players, non-players, or objects within five yards of or on the
playing field, any player that is physically obstructed by these obstacles or the thrower in
possession of the disc may call this violation. Play resumes at the stall count reached plus one,
or 9 if over 8.
