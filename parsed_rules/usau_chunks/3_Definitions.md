## 3. Definitions

<!-- section: 3 source: usau -->

### 3.A. Best perspective: The most complete view available by a player that includes the relative
<!-- rule: 3.A source: usau -->

positions of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a play. On an unlined field,
this may require sighting from one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs to a
player. However, players may rely on the following sources as a component of best perspective:
    - **3.A.1.** Players may seek the perspective of sideline players to clarify the rules and to assist
      <!-- rule: 3.A.1 source: usau -->
players in making the appropriate call. Players may seek the perspective of coaches to
clarify a rule, but not to assist in making the appropriate call.
      - **3.A.1.a.** Sideline players should not offer their perspective unless solicited by a
        <!-- rule: 3.A.1.a source: usau -->
player. However, a sideline player may offer perspective without being
asked by a player if the perspective offered is to the detriment of the
sideline player’s team.
    - **3.A.2.** Players may review officially-designated video footage to assist in resolving a call
      <!-- rule: 3.A.2 source: usau -->
where such footage is available. However, play may not be delayed to review video
footage.  [[For example, live instant replay in a stadium setting may be used by players
to resolve a contested foul call. Players may not, however, request that a particular
play be replayed on the screen. If, after reviewing the video, players still cannot agree,
they should not delay the game to rewatch the play multiple times; instead, the play
should be treated as a regular contested foul.]]
If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the disc should revert to the thrower (in
the case of in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with the receiver on the
end zone line (in the case of goal/non-goal disputes).
### 3.B. Foul: Non-Incidental contact between opposing players (see 3.E for a definition of incidental
<!-- rule: 3.B source: usau -->

contact). In general, the player initiating the contact has committed the foul.
### 3.C. Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or
<!-- rule: 3.C source: usau -->

maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being
off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground (4.A.1).
### 3.D. Guarding: A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within 10 feet of that
<!-- rule: 3.D source: usau -->

offensive player and are reacting to that offensive player.  [[A defender who turns away from an
offensive player and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no longer guarding that
offensive player.]]
### 3.E. Incidental contact: Contact between opposing players that does not affect continued play.  [[For
<!-- rule: 3.E source: usau -->

example, contact affects continued play if the contact knocks a player off-balance and interferes
with their ability to continue cutting or playing defense.]]
### 3.F. 
<!-- rule: 3.F source: usau -->

Legal position: A position established by a marker that does not violate any of the provisions
outlined in 16.  [[This refers to legal marking position. In general, this means there is sufficient
space between the marker and the thrower’s torso, the marker is not straddling the pivot, and
the marker’s arms are not "wrapping" the thrower.]]
### 3.G. Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary
<!-- rule: 3.G source: usau -->

line segment between two field markers with the thickness of said markers. Line segments are
not extrapolated beyond the defining markers.
### 3.H. Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during
<!-- rule: 3.H source: usau -->

a thrower's possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake.
When there is a definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of the body in contact with
that spot is the pivot.  [[This is not a body part, but rather an infinitesimally small point on the
body.]]
### 3.I. 
<!-- rule: 3.I source: usau -->

Possession of the disc: Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.
    - **3.I.1.** Catching a pass is equivalent to establishing possession of that pass.
      <!-- rule: 3.I.1 source: usau -->
    - **3.I.2.** If a player loses possession of a disc during movement related to a catch, the initial
      <!-- rule: 3.I.2 source: usau -->
possession ends.  [[A disc that touches the ground while in a player’s possession is not
a turnover.]]
    - **3.I.3.** On a throw, the thrower's possession ends when they are no longer in contact with the
      <!-- rule: 3.I.3 source: usau -->
disc.
    - **3.I.4.** A disc in a player's possession is considered part of that player.  [[Thus, hitting the disc
      <!-- rule: 3.I.4 source: usau -->
in a player’s possession is a foul.]]
    - **3.I.5.** The team whose player is in possession, or whose players may pick up the disc, is
      <!-- rule: 3.I.5 source: usau -->
considered the team in possession. If the disc is in the air following a legal pass, the
thrower's team is considered the team in possession.
    - **3.I.6.** If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offensive player
      <!-- rule: 3.I.6 source: usau -->
retains possession and becomes the thrower.
### 3.J. 
<!-- rule: 3.J source: usau -->

Pull: The throw from one team to the other that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a
goal. It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special provisions (Section 9). The player
on the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals readiness is the puller. The pulling team
may designate a new puller at any time before the pull.
### 3.K. Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at the beginning of the game or when the previous
<!-- rule: 3.K source: usau -->

goal is scored and ends when the next goal is scored.
### 3.L. 
<!-- rule: 3.L source: usau -->

State of the disc: The nature of play at a particular moment during the game. There are three
states of the disc:
    - **3.L.1.** A disc is “in play” when players are allowed to move and play may proceed without the
      <!-- rule: 3.L.1 source: usau -->
defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play. The disc
is subject to a turnover. If no player has possession of a disc in play, any offensive
player may become the thrower by taking possession of the disc (10.B). Once a player
has possession of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc (10.B.2)
prior to attempting a pass (19.A).
    - **3.L.2.** A disc is “live” when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover,
      <!-- rule: 3.L.2 source: usau -->
but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is
to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must (1) establish a
pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the disc to the ground (10.CB).
    - **3.L.3.** A disc is “dead” when play has stopped and can continue only with a check (see
      <!-- rule: 3.L.3 source: usau -->
### 10.D. ). The disc is not subject to a turnover. A dead disc may change states to either
<!-- rule: 10.D source: usau -->

live or in play after a check depending on the circumstances.
### 3.M. Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check
<!-- rule: 3.M source: usau -->

or self-check to restart play. The term “play stops” means a stoppage of play occurs.
[[ Play-halting calls include "foul," "violation," "pick," "stall," etc.]]
### 3.N. Throw: A disc in flight following any throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the thrower
<!-- rule: 3.N source: usau -->

losing contact with the disc.
    - **3.N.1.** A pass is equivalent to a throw.  [[The rules use “pass” and “throw” interchangeably.]]
      <!-- rule: 3.N.1 source: usau -->
    - **3.N.2.** An intentionally dropped disc is considered a thrown disc. An accidentally dropped
      <!-- rule: 3.N.2 source: usau -->
(falling, non-spinning) disc is not a throw.
    - **3.N.3.** An accidentally released, spinning flying disc is a throw, not a dropped disc.
      <!-- rule: 3.N.3 source: usau -->
    - **3.N.4.** The act of throwing is the motion that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc
      <!-- rule: 3.N.4 source: usau -->
in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the
act of throwing.
    - **3.N.5.** A throw is complete when any catch results in the team in possession of the disc
      <!-- rule: 3.N.5 source: usau -->
retaining possession. Any throw that is not complete is incomplete.
### 3.O. Thrower: An offensive player in possession of, or who has most recently possessed, the disc,
<!-- rule: 3.O source: usau -->

is the thrower.
    - **3.O.1.** When catching a pass, a player becomes the thrower immediately upon establishing
      <!-- rule: 3.O.1 source: usau -->
possession of the disc (20.E.1.h).
### 3.P. 
<!-- rule: 3.P source: usau -->

Violation: Any infraction of the rules other than a foul.
### 3.Q. Roles
<!-- rule: 3.Q source: usau -->

    - **3.Q.1.** Captain: A team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and has been
