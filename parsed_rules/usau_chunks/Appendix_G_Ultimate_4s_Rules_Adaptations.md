## Appendix G: Ultimate 4’s Rules Adaptations

<!-- section: Appendix G source: usau -->

Overview  - Ultimate 4’s is an exciting and accessible  variation of ultimate adapted for smaller
teams and smaller fields. Like other variations that use smaller numbers, such as Beach
Ultimate, 4’s helps create an opportunity for more involvement from everyone on the field. With
shorter stall counts, play moves at a faster pace, and the smaller field creates a space where
more throwers can reach all areas of the field. The need for fewer people and less field space
makes the sport more accessible in multiple ways. While played with most of the same rules as
regulation ultimate, including field surface, matches consist of multiple short games rather than
one long one. The first team to win two of the three games wins the match, a format which lends
itself to exciting comebacks and thrilling tie-breakers.
The following adaptations to the rules are to be used in Ultimate 4’s competition. These
adaptations may be additions to the current official rules or may supersede existing rules. Other
than these additions and changes, the current official rules apply to Ultimate 4’s competition.
Field size (yards)
Length: Central Zone (goal line to goal line)
Central Zone Length: 37
Width: 25
End Zone: 8
Total Length: 53
Note: Total length is the approximate width of
an American football field.
Matches and Games
Matches are best of 3 games.
The third game is not required if one team
wins the first two games.
Point Totals
The first two games are to 5.
The third game, if necessary, is to 3.*
Start of the Game
The first game of the match (see “Point
Totals”) begins according to Section 9.A. and
the usual choice of end zone or possession.
The initial choices are reversed at the start of
the second game. If there is a tie-breaker
game, then the teams fairly re-determine
(according to Section 9.A) which team has
the choice of end zone or possession.**
Pull
Each point starts with a pull, and teams
switch ends of the field after each point, as
normal, with the following exception.
Any pull that touches the out-of-bounds area
results in a brick. This includes all perimeter
lines and includes any contact with those
out-of-bounds areas even after the pull has
hit the ground.
The brick is at mid-field.
Time Between Pulls
Time limits are adjusted as follows:
30 seconds: Offense must be lined up
45 seconds: Offense must signal readiness
60 seconds: Defense must pull
Stall Count
Stalls are 7 seconds (starting with 1 going to
7).
Stall at the “S” in “seven.”
Stall counts resume as in 15.F with the
following adaptations:
–
“9 if over 8” becomes “6 if over 5”
–
“6 if over 5” becomes “4 if over 3”
–
Contested stall
–
First call “5”
–
Second and subsequent calls
when due to a fast count “3”
Time Outs
1 timeout per team per game
Point Differential/Tie Breaks in Pools in
Tournament Format
Add 3 bonus points for winning the first two
games, in addition to actual point
differential.***
Time of Game and Matches (caps)
20 minutes each for first 2 games
10 minutes for last game
Hard cap for first game
Hard cap for 2nd game (but can be started as
soon as first game ends)
Hard cap for 3rd game
Mixed Personnel Ratios
Always 2 man-matching and 2
woman-matching mixed play
As with any new rules variation, there is an opportunity to experiment with a number of
elements outlined above. The following are suggestions for potential areas for
experimentation.
* The tie-break game could be extended from 3 to 5. This will impact the timing of the last game
and the match as a whole, which would need to be extended.
** Rather than re-determining choice at the start of the tie-break, the pull and sides could be
determined by continuing the ongoing alternating sequence, automatically giving the team that
wins the first game first possession in the tie-break. Or give the previous losing team first choice
of side/possession in second (and third) games.
*** The sweep point differential bonus could be adjusted up or down. Tie-breaks could also be
considered that track games won/lost differential and gives a +1 game bonus to a sweep before
moving on to point differential.
