## Appendix C: Misconduct System

<!-- section: Appendix C source: usau -->

This appendix describes the system for handling misconduct within a game that is using observers. For
games without observers, behavior expectations and related procedures are described in Section 2 (Spirit
of the Game). Additional mechanisms for handling misconduct at the event level or beyond are described
in the USA Ultimate Conduct Policy.
The “Event Disciplinary Authority” (EDA) is defined by section A.a of the USAU Event Disciplinary
Authority Guidelines [https://usaultimate.org/conduct/event-disciplinary-authority/].
B5.  Misconduct Fouls
C1.A.  Any observer may assess a Technical Foul, blue card, yellow card, or red card.
C1.A.1.  The infraction must have been witnessed by at least one observer.
C1.A.2.  The infraction must have occurred during the game.
C1.A.2.a.  This includes the time preceding and following the game, when members
from teams are present in the vicinity of the field.
C1.B.  Technical Foul
C1.B.1.  A Technical Foul can be assessed against a team for minor conduct violations that
do not affect competitiveness or Spirit of the Game.
C1.B.2.  Technical Fouls shall be assessed at the next stoppage of play (3.M), or when the
current scoring attempt (3.K) is completed.
C1.B.3.  There is no limit to the number of Technical Fouls a team can accrue during a game.
C1.B.4.  Technical Fouls do not carry over beyond the game in which they are issued.
C1.C.  Blue Card
C1.C.1.  A blue card can be assessed against a team for conduct that affects
competitiveness or violates Spirit of the Game by any team member or spectators
considered as partisans for the team.
C1.C.2.  The blue card can be assessed regardless of whether the infracted team makes any
call, although teams are encouraged to make violation calls in order to directly
communicate about issues and minimize the need for observers to issue blue cards
without a call.
C1.C.3.  Blue cards shall be assessed at the next stoppage of play (3.M), or when the current
scoring attempt (3.K) is completed.
C1.C.4.  There is no limit to the number of blue cards a team can accrue during a game.
C1.C.5.  Blue cards do not carry over beyond the game in which they are issued.
C1.D.  Yellow Card
C1.D.1.  A yellow card can be assessed against a specific team member for particularly
egregious conduct or a pattern of such behavior. A yellow card is a formal warning
for unacceptable behavior and puts the team member on notice that any further
such actions will result in ejection from the game.
C1.D.2.  The yellow card can be assessed regardless of whether the infracted team makes
any call, although teams are encouraged to make violation calls in order to directly
communicate about issues and minimize the need for observers to issue yellow
cards without a call.
C1.D.3.  Observers may stop play to issue a yellow card.
C1.D.3.a.  If play is stopped to assess a yellow card, for the purpose of the
Continuation Rule (17.C), the situation should be treated like an injury
called at the time of the infraction.
C1.D.3.b.  Observers may delay the stoppage until the infracted team is no longer in
possession of the disc.
C1.D.3.c.  Observers may issue a yellow card during a subsequent stoppage if an
observer consultation is needed to determine whether a yellow card is
warranted.
C1.D.4.  A yellow card is non-reviewable for the duration of the game, although it may be
appealed to the EDA after the game.
C1.D.5.  One blue card is automatically assessed against a team whenever one of its
members receives a yellow card.
C1.E.  Red Card
C1.E.1.  A red card can be assessed against a specific team member for particularly
egregious conduct that warrants immediate suspension from the game.
C1.E.2.  No formal or informal warning is necessary before a team member is issued a red
card, and a red card need not be preceded by a blue card or yellow card.
C1.E.3.  Observers may stop play to assess a red card, and should stop as soon as possible.
C1.E.3.a.  If observers stop play to issue a red card, for the purpose of the
Continuation Rule (17.C), the situation should be treated like an injury at
the time of the infraction.
B5.A.1.a.  Observers may issue a red card during a subsequent stoppage if an
observer consultation is needed to determine whether a red card is
warranted.
C1.E.4.  A red card is non-reviewable for the duration of the game, although it may be
appealed to the EDA after the game.
C1.E.5.  Two blue cards are automatically assessed against a team whenever one of its
members receives a red card.
C2.  Behavior Warranting Misconduct Fouls
C2.A.  Teams are encouraged to demonstrate good Spirit (2.E) and resolve disagreements between
themselves. When such a resolution is not possible, or when behavior clearly violates Spirit of
the Game (2.F), observers may assess Misconduct Fouls.
C2.B.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of behaviors that may result in Misconduct Fouls. When
warranted by the severity or circumstances of the conduct, more serious penalties than those
illustrated may be applied.
C2.C.  Dangerous Play
C2.C.1.  All observer-ruled or uncontested player-called dangerous plays (20.B) shall receive
a yellow card.
C2.C.2.  Dangerous plays that are particularly egregious (reasonable certainty of violent
contact with a player’s knees or head, or other injurious behavior) may result in a
red card.
C2.D.  Battery and Fighting
C2.D.1.  Intentionally striking another person, or any clear attempt to do so, warrants a red
card. This includes, but is not limited to: punching or attempting to punch, kicking or
attempting to kick, spitting on or attempting to spit on someone.
C2.E.  Pushing and Shoving
C2.E.1.  Aggressively pushing or shoving another player, or other acts of physical aggression
warrant a yellow card or red card.
C2.F.  Repeated Infractions
C2.F.1.  Repeated instances of the same infraction may receive a blue card.
C2.F.2.  Continued instances of a repeated infraction after a blue card has been issued
(C2.G.1) may receive a yellow card.
C2.G. Egregious Infractions
C2.G.1.  Egregious instances of any infraction may receive a blue card or yellow card.
C2.H.  Deliberate Infractions
B5.A.2.  Deliberate infractions may receive a yellow card.
C2.I.  Incorrect or Invalid Calls
C2.I.1.  Calls or contests that are knowingly incorrect or made with disregard for their validity
may result in a blue card.
C2.I.2.  Continued instances of calls or contests that are knowingly incorrect or made with
disregard for their validity after a blue card has been issued (C2.I.1) may receive a
yellow card.
C2.J.  Taunting and Spiking
C2.J.1.  Taunting an opponent or spiking the disc towards a player warrants either a blue
card or yellow card, depending on the severity of the behavior.
C2.J.2.  Forcibly spiking, or attempting to forcibly spike a disc on a player is considered
intentionally striking (C2.D.1).
C2.J.3.  If a team member spikes the disc without intending to hit another person, and it does
hit an opposing team member, a blue card or yellow card may be assessed at the
discretion of the observer.
C2.K.  Verbal Abuse
C2.K.1.  Verbal abuse directed at a player, game official, spectator, or tournament official
warrants a blue card or yellow card, depending on the severity and extent of the
language. This includes continued dissent with observer rulings.
C2.K.2.  Egregious verbal abuse such as racial and gender based slurs warrants a red card.
C2.L.  Swearing
C2.L.1.  General undirected swearing in accordance with specific written guidelines for a
tournament warrants a Technical Foul.
C2.M. Sideline Encroachment
C2.M.1.  Sideline encroachment that does not affect an observer’s ability to make a call
warrants a Technical Foul.
C2.M.2.  Sideline encroachment that interferes with play or affects an observer’s ability to
make a call warrants a blue card.
C2.M.3.  Non-player (3.Q.10) team members entering the playing field before a goal has
been signaled by an observer warrants a Technical Foul.
C2.N.  Any other behavior described by the USAU Code of Conduct may warrant a misconduct foul at
the discretion of the observer.
C2.O. Any behavior that would warrant the issuance of a misconduct foul, but which occurs in a
game without observers, can result in sanctions upon a complaint filed to the EDA.
C3.  Penalties
C3.A.  This section does not limit additional sanctions that may be issued by the EDA after a game.
C3.B.  Suspension
C3.B.1.  A team member shall receive a game suspension upon receiving
C3.B.1.a.  two yellow cards during a game, or
C3.B.1.b.  a red card.
C3.B.2.  If a team member receives a game suspension in the second half of a game, the
suspension remains in effect for the first half of the team’s next game.
C3.B.3.  A team member shall be suspended for the remainder of a tournament upon
receiving:
C3.B.4.  three yellow cards in a tournament, or
C3.B.5.  one yellow card and one red card in a tournament, or
C3.B.6.  two red cards in a tournament.
C3.B.7.  A suspended team member must immediately leave the general area where their
game is being played, as directed by the EDA.
C3.B.7.a.  In practice this means the team member must remove themselves at
least 100 yards from their team’s current playing field and refrain from
interacting with any team members, spectators, or officials involved in
that game.
C3.B.7.b.  Failure to do so results in a forfeit for that team member’s team.
C3.B.8.  If a team member participates in a game from which they have been suspended,
that team member is suspended for the entire tournament, and the team member’s
team forfeits that game.
C3.B.9.  A team whose player(3.Q.10) is suspended may substitute another player, and the
opposing team also may exchange a player if they wish.
C3.B.10.  All players must remain in the positions they occupied when play stopped, unless
the ejection also triggers a Team Misconduct Penalty (B3.C).
C3.B.11.  A suspension is non-reviewable for the duration of the game when it was assessed,
although it may be appealed to the EDA after the game.
C3.B.12.  A suspension does not carry over to subsequent tournaments.
C3.C.  Team Misconduct Penalty
C3.C.1.  A Team Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed against a team when a Technical
Foul is assessed against a team, and the team previously accumulated two or more
Technical Fouls.
C3.C.2.  A Team Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed against a team when a blue card is
assessed against a team, and the team has previously accumulated two or more
blue cards.
C3.C.3.  A Team Misconduct Penalty shall be assessed at the next stoppage of play (3.M), or
when the current scoring attempt (3.K) is completed. This includes stoppages
initiated due to a yellow card (B1.D.3) or red card (B1.E.3).
C3.C.4.  When a Team Misconduct Penalty is assessed against the offense, the defense has
two options available to continue play.
C3.C.4.a.  The disc is moved to the reverse brick mark, away from the end zone of
attack. The offense is given 30 seconds to set up anywhere on the
playing field. After all offensive players have assumed stationary
positions, the defense has an additional 20 seconds to match up and
check the disc in with a stall count of one.
C3.C.4.b.  The disc and players stay where they were when play stopped. Once
players are ready, the count resumes at the stall count reached plus one,
or at nine if over eight.
C3.C.5.  When a Team Misconduct Penalty is assessed against the defense, the offense has
three options available to continue play.
C3.C.5.a.  The disc is moved to the brick mark closest to the end zone of attack.
The offense has 30 seconds to set up anywhere on the playing field.
After all offensive players have assumed stationary positions, the
defense has an additional 20 seconds to match up and check the disc in
with a stall count of one.
C3.C.5.b.  The disc is centered on the long axis of the field. The offense has 30
seconds to set up anywhere on the playing field. After all offensive
players have assumed stationary positions, the defense has an
additional 20 seconds to match up and check the disc in with a stall
count of one.
C3.C.5.c.  The disc and players stay where they were when play stopped. Once
players are ready, the defense checks in the disc with a stall count of
one.
C3.C.6.  Team Misconduct Penalty Assessed Between Points
C3.C.6.a.  If a Team Misconduct Penalty is assessed after the completion of a point,
there is no pull.
C3.C.6.b.  If the penalty is against the receiving team, the disc is put into play at the
brick mark in the end zone they are defending (C3.C.4.a).
C3.C.6.c.  If the penalty is against the pulling team, the receiving team puts the disc
into play at the brick mark closest to the end zone they are attacking
(B3.C.5.a).
C3.C.6.d.  Each team may substitute players as per 8.A.1.
C3.C.6.e.  Each offensive player must establish a stationary position by 90 seconds
after the previous goal was scored.
C3.C.6.f.  The defense has 100 seconds after the previous goal was scored or up
to 20 seconds after all offensive players have established their positions
(whichever is longer) to check the disc into play.
C3.C.7.  Declined Team Misconduct Penalties
C3.C.7.a.  A captain (3.Q.1) can decline a misconduct penalty and leave the disc as
is.
C3.C.7.b.  In exceptional circumstances, observers may deny the declination if they
feel the teams are trying to circumvent mandatory tournament rules,
guidelines, or player safety.
C3.D.  Game Forfeiture
C3.D.1.  If five yellow cards are assessed against team members on a single team during a
game, that team forfeits the game. For this purpose, a red card is equivalent to two
yellow cards. For example, if three or more players on a single team are assessed
red cards, that team forfeits the game.
C3.D.2.  If the situation arises where both teams would be required to forfeit the game
(C3.D.1) due to multiple simultaneously assessed misconduct fouls, the EDA
determines the appropriate outcome based on competition considerations.
