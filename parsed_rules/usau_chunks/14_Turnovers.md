## 14. Turnovers

<!-- section: 14 source: usau -->

### 14.A. A turnover results when:
<!-- rule: 14.A source: usau -->

    - **14.A.1.** a pass is incomplete;
      <!-- rule: 14.A.1 source: usau -->
    - **14.A.2.** a disc contacts the ground while not in possession of a player other than as a result
      <!-- rule: 14.A.2 source: usau -->
of a pull; or
    - **14.A.3.** a disc becomes out-of-bounds other than as a result of a pull.
      <!-- rule: 14.A.3 source: usau -->
### 14.B. If the thrower accidentally drops a live disc or a disc in play without defensive interference and it
<!-- rule: 14.B source: usau -->

contacts the ground before the thrower regains possession, it is considered a turnover. If the
thrower regains possession of an accidentally dropped disc before it contacts the ground without
another player touching the disc, that possession is considered continuous, and the stall count
continues uninterrupted.  If the thrower regains possession of an accidentally dropped disc
before it contacts the ground and after another player touches it, it is considered a new
possession.
### 14.C. A pass is intercepted if a defensive player obtains possession of the disc, but if the defender
<!-- rule: 14.C source: usau -->

accidentally loses possession of the disc before or during ground contact related to the catch,
the pass is considered incomplete rather than intercepted.  [[i.e., this is not a "double-turnover" –
the defender’s team still gains possession.]]
### 14.D. The following actions result in a turnover and a stoppage of play:
<!-- rule: 14.D source: usau -->

    - **14.D.1.** The marker's count reaches ten before the throw is released (15.D).
      <!-- rule: 14.D.1 source: usau -->
    - **14.D.2.** The thrower hands the disc to another player.
      <!-- rule: 14.D.2 source: usau -->
    - **14.D.3.** The thrower catches a legally thrown disc. However, it is not a turnover if another
      <!-- rule: 14.D.3 source: usau -->
player touches the disc during its flight unless the thrower intentionally deflected the
disc off another player.
    - **14.D.4.** An offensive player intentionally assists a teammate's movement to catch a pass.
      <!-- rule: 14.D.4 source: usau -->
[[The official interpretation of this rule is that a player is prohibited from intentionally
pushing off of a teammate to jump higher]]  If a defender intentionally assists a
teammate's movement to block or intercept a pass, the intended receiver is awarded
possession at the spot on the playing field nearest the location the intended receiver
occupied at the time of the infraction. If the intended receiver was in the end zone,
### 12.B. and 12.C apply.
<!-- rule: 12.B source: usau -->

    - **14.D.5.** An offensive player uses an item of equipment to assist in catching a pass (e.g.,
      <!-- rule: 14.D.5 source: usau -->
throwing a hat or shirt at the disc). If a defender uses an item of equipment to assist
in blocking or intercepting a pass, the intended receiver is awarded possession at the
spot on the playing field nearest the location the intended receiver occupied at the
time of the infraction. If the intended receiver was in the end zone, 12.B and 12.C
apply.  [[Tacky gloves are legal and do not result in a turnover under this rule.]]
