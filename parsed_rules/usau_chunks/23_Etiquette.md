### 23.B. On a stoppage of play, if it is ever unclear which of a team's members are the current players or
<!-- rule: 23.B source: usau -->

where they are on or off the field, they should identify themselves when the opposing team
requests.
### 23.C. If a dispute arises on the field, play stops and is restarted with a check when the matter is
<!-- rule: 23.C source: usau -->

resolved.
### 23.D. If a novice player commits an infraction out of sincere ignorance of the rules, it should be
<!-- rule: 23.D source: usau -->

common practice to stop play and explain the infraction.
### 23.E. In addition to the assumption that players will not intentionally violate the rules, players are
