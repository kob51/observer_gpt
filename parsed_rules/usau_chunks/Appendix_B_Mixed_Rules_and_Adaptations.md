## Appendix B: Mixed Rules and Adaptations

<!-- section: Appendix B source: usau -->

B1.  Personnel Ratio Rules
B1.A.  The default personnel ratio for the mixed division is 4/3 (four woman-matching and three
man-matching or four man-matching and three woman-matching).
B1.B.  Prescribed Ratio Rule (ABBA): At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional
disc flip happens with the winner selecting the gender ratio for the first point. For the second
and third points the ratio must be the reverse of the first point. For the fourth and fifth points
the ratio must be the same as the first point. This pattern of alternating the ratio every two
points repeats until the end of the game. Half time does not impact the pattern. This is the
preferred Personnel Ratio Rule for sanctioned play.
B1.C.  Endzone Decides Ratio Rule: At the start of the game, after the first disc flip, an additional disc
flip happens with the winner selecting which end zone is “end zone A,” with the other end zone
becoming “end zone B.”  At the start of each point in the first half, the team that is defending
end zone A must choose the mixed personnel ratio. For the second half, at the start of each
point the team that is defending end zone B must choose the mixed personnel ratio.
B1.D.  Receiving Team Decides Ratio Rule: At the start of each point in the game, the receiving team
must choose the mixed personnel ratio.
B1.E.  If the Endzone Decides Ratio Rule or the Receiving Team Decides Ratio Rule is in effect for
the game, the team responsible for signaling the personnel ratio for the upcoming point must
do so within twenty five (25) seconds after the previous goal was scored.  [[The team
responsible for signaling the personnel ratio is encouraged to signal as early as possible after
the previous goal is scored, but must do so no later than 25 seconds.]]
B1.F.  If a team cannot match the on-field personnel ratio of all seven players for the point, then it
must play with fewer than seven players, but no less than five, matching the personnel ratio
with as many players as possible.
B1.G.  Personnel Ratio Violation: If the disc has been pulled and a team has the incorrect personnel
ratio, it is a violation.
B1.G.1.  Violations of the mixed personnel ratio and how they are handled after the pull are
described in 2026-2027 Official Rules of Ultimate (9.C.1).
B2.  Gender Match Signalling
B2.A.  If Gender Match Signaling is to be requested, team and/or spirit captains must discuss and
agree to do so during the captains’ meeting prior to the start of the game. If teams do not
reach agreement, then players will signal gender as described in B2.B. Exception: If it
becomes apparent, after the start of the game, that Gender Match Signalling is needed, team
and/or spirit captains will need to meet and mutually agree for both sides to begin doing so. No
player, captain, or coach may make a spur-of-the-moment request for the opposing team to
signal their respective gender matches between points.
B2.B.  Players on the receiving team will signal their gender match (either “man-matching” or
“woman-matching”) within 50 seconds after the previous goal was scored for the purpose of
allowing the pulling team to match up defensively. The pulling team is permitted to remind the
receiving team to signal their respective gender matches as long as it was previously agreed
upon, per B2.A.
B3.  Pull Rules
B3.A.  Majority Pull Rule
B3.A.1.  Each point, a player representing the gender match-up with four players on the field
must pull for that point. That is, if there are four women-matching players then a
woman-matching player must pull. This is the preferred rule for sanctioned play.
B3.A.2.  Majority Pull Violation: Violations of the gender match pull rule will be handled the
same as an offsides violation (9.B.4.d), but instead of calling "offsides," a player
should call "majority pull violation." Like with offsides violations, after the first
majority pull violation, any subsequent majority pull violations should be handled as
described in 9.D.4. Majority Pull Rule violations accumulate together with offsides
and false start violations as “pull violations.” In games with observers, either the
observer or a player on the field may call the violation.
B3.B.  If the Majority Pull Rule is not used, then any of the players on the pulling team may pull.
B4.  Player Substitutions
B4.A.  Substituting players must be of the same gender match as the player they are replacing.
