## 13. Scoring

<!-- section: 13 source: usau -->

### 13.A. A goal is scored when an in-bounds player catches any legal pass in the end zone of attack, and
<!-- rule: 13.A source: usau -->

retains possession of the disc throughout all ground contact related to the catch.
    - **13.A.1.** To be considered in the end zone after gaining possession of the disc in accordance
      <!-- rule: 13.A.1 source: usau -->
with 3.I.2 and 17.E, the player's first point of ground contact must be completely in the
end zone. If the player loses possession due to ground contact related to the catch
and any offensive player subsequently gains possession of the disc before a turnover
occurs, the first point of ground contact of the subsequent possession must be
completely in the endzone.  [[If a player clearly lands on their toes first and then
continues down onto their heels, their toes are the first point of ground contact. If a
player lands fairly flat-footed and it is not possible to determine which part of the foot
contacted the ground first, the entire foot is the first point of ground contact.]] [[If a
player catches a disc outside of their end zone of attack, loses possession during
ground contact related to the catch, bobbles the disc, and then re-gains possession of
the disc with their first point of ground contact of this subsequent possession
completely in the end zone, it is a goal.]]
    - **13.A.2.** When an in-bounds player in possession of the disc whose first ground contact will be
      <!-- rule: 13.A.2 source: usau -->
completely within the end zone loses possession of the disc due to an uncontested
foul, or lands out of the end zone due to an uncontested force-out foul (20.E.2.d), that
player is awarded a goal.
### 13.B. If after receiving a pass outside the end zone, a player comes to a stop contacting the end zone
<!-- rule: 13.B source: usau -->

without a pivot on the central zone, that player must carry the disc back to, and put it into play at,
the closest spot on the goal line.
### 13.C. If a player scores according to 13.A, but then unknowingly throws another pass, a goal is
<!-- rule: 13.C source: usau -->

awarded to that player, regardless of the outcome of the pass. However, if it is unclear if the
player scored according to 13.A (i.e., there is no agreement on the player who had best
perspective, and there are opposing viewpoints on the play), the result of the pass stands.
### 13.D. If a player catches the disc and believes a goal has been scored the player may call “goal” and
<!-- rule: 13.D source: usau -->

play stops. A player may not call “goal” prior to the completion of all ground contact related to
the catch. Best practice is to announce “goal” and raise both hands vertically above the head.
After a contested or retracted goal call, play must restart with a check and the call is deemed to
have been made when the pass was caught.  [[Accordingly, the stall count will resume at 1 (15.F,
      - **15.F.1.e.** ). When repositioning, all players should return to where they were when the pass was
        <!-- rule: 15.F.1.e source: usau -->
caught (17.C.6.a).]]  [[In an observed game, in/out of the end zone and “goal” are active observer
calls, and player calls are ignored. Therefore, in an observed game, a player’s “goal” call does
not stop play.]] [[If it is ever unclear whether “goal” was called, play continues and 13.C applies
to subsequent throws (undisputed goals stand, turnovers stand on disputed goals). Celebration
or other actions following a suspected goal do not substitute for a “goal” call under this rule.]]
### 13.E. The act of scoring a goal is subject to rule 3.I.2.
