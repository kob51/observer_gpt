## 15. Stalling

<!-- section: 15 source: usau -->

### 15.A. Stalling: The period of time within which a thrower must release a throw may be timed by the
<!-- rule: 15.A source: usau -->

stall count.
### 15.B. The stall count consists of announcing “stalling” and counting from one to ten loudly enough
<!-- rule: 15.B source: usau -->

for the thrower to hear.
    - **15.B.1.** The interval between the first utterance of each number in the stall count must be at
      <!-- rule: 15.B.1 source: usau -->
least one second.  [[Thus, a legal count from one to ten will take a minimum of 9
seconds. It is legal to count at intervals greater than one second between numbers]]
    - **15.B.2.** All stall counts initiated, reinitiated or resumed after a stoppage of play must start
      <!-- rule: 15.B.2 source: usau -->
with the word “stalling.”
    - **15.B.3.** If the count resets to one during a stoppage of play, it is considered a new count.
      <!-- rule: 15.B.3 source: usau -->
### 15.C. Only the marker (3 .Q.6 ) may initiate or continue a stall count, and may do so anytime a
<!-- rule: 15.C source: usau -->

thrower has possession of a disc that is live or in play.
    - **15.C.1.** Additionally, the marker may initiate or continue a stall count (even before a thrower
      <!-- rule: 15.C.1 source: usau -->
gains possession) if delay of game or pre-stall rules (10 .B.3 , 10.B.4, 10.B.5, or
      - **7.B.4.d.** ) apply and have been satisfied.
        <!-- rule: 7.B.4.d source: usau -->
    - **15.C.2.** However, unless 15.C.1 applies, the stall count may not be initiated or resumed
      <!-- rule: 15.C.2 source: usau -->
before a pivot is established:
      - **15.C.2.a.** directly after a turnover,
        <!-- rule: 15.C.2.a source: usau -->
      - **15.C.2.b.** when putting the pull into play, and
        <!-- rule: 15.C.2.b source: usau -->
      - **15.C.2.c.** after a travel is called and no pass has been attempted.
        <!-- rule: 15.C.2.c source: usau -->
### 15.D. If the thrower has not released the disc at the first utterance of the word “ten,” it is a turnover.
<!-- rule: 15.D source: usau -->

The marker loudly announces “stall” and play stops. If the disc is thrown, play continues until
the outcome of that pass is determined. A stall is not a violation and the Continuation Rule
(17.C) does not apply.
    - **15.D.1.** If the stall is uncontested, the disc is returned to the thrower at the place of the stall.
      <!-- rule: 15.D.1 source: usau -->
The thrower then places the disc on the ground and loudly announces “3-2-1 disc
in” and the disc is in play.
    - **15.D.2.** The thrower may contest a stall call in the belief that the disc was released before
      <!-- rule: 15.D.2 source: usau -->
the first utterance of the word “ten”  or if the marker committed a fast count such that
the thrower did not have a reasonable opportunity to call “fast count” before the first
utterance of the word “ten.” If a stall is contested:
      - **15.D.2.a.** If the pass was complete or 16.F.2 applies, play stops, players return to
        <!-- rule: 15.D.2.a source: usau -->
their positions at the time of the throw, and possession reverts to the
thrower. After a check, the marker resumes the stall count according to
      - **15.F.2.c.** 
        <!-- rule: 15.F.2.c source: usau -->
      - **15.D.2.b.** If the pass was incomplete, it is a turnover; play stops and resumes with a
        <!-- rule: 15.D.2.b source: usau -->
check.
      - **15.D.2.c.** If a stall call is retracted and the thrower attempted a pass, the outcome
        <!-- rule: 15.D.2.c source: usau -->
of the pass stands and play restarts with a check.  [[A marker should not
automatically call “stall” because they got to the count of ten. They should
be certain that the disc was not yet released and that their count wasn’t
fast.]]
### 15.E. If the defense switches markers, the new marker must reinitiate the stall count.  [[Reinitiate the
<!-- rule: 15.E source: usau -->

stall count means to start over ("stalling one…").]]  A marker leaving the ten foot radius and
returning is considered a new marker.
### 15.F. If a stall count is interrupted by a call, the thrower and marker are responsible for agreeing on
<!-- rule: 15.F source: usau -->

the correct count before the check. The count reached is the last number fully uttered by the
marker before the call. The count is resumed with the word “stalling” followed by the number
listed below:
    - **15.F.1.** General Rules:
      <!-- rule: 15.F.1 source: usau -->
a. Uncontested defensive foul or violation
b. Uncontested offensive foul or violation
Count reached plus 1, or 9 if over 8
c. Contested foul or violation
Count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5
d. Offsetting calls
Count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5
e. Unresolved calls
Count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5
f. Retracted defensive calls
g. Retracted offensive calls
Count reached plus 1, or 9 if over 8
    - **15.F.2.** Specific Rules:
      <!-- rule: 15.F.2 source: usau -->
a. Pick
Count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5
b. Marking violation (no stoppage)
Count reached minus 1, no “stalling”
c. Contested stall
