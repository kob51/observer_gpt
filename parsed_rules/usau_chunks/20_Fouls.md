## 20. Fouls

<!-- section: 20 source: usau -->

### 20.A. It is the responsibility of all players to avoid initiating contact in every way possible.  [[Avoid
<!-- rule: 20.A source: usau -->

initiating contact in every way reasonably possible, while still playing ultimate. Some contact is
inevitable, but players have an affirmative obligation to make reasonable efforts to avoid
initiating contact. This includes, but is not exclusive to, contact initiated with non-throwers (i.e.,
cutters and handlers) prior to starting or restarting play, as well as mid-play. Moreover, in
instances of severe contact, such as a violent collision, a player anticipating a violent collision
has responsibility to avoid the collision, even if not initiated by the player; one may not attempt to
“win the collision.”]]
### 20.B. Dangerous Play. Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of or posing a
<!-- rule: 20.B source: usau -->

significant risk of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behavior are
considered “dangerous play” and are treated as a foul. The proper call in such circumstances is
“dangerous play” and play stops. This rule is not superseded by any other rule.  [[The following
are non-exhaustive examples of behaviors that can result in a dangerous play and therefore
should be avoided:
●
significantly colliding with a mostly stationary opponent,
●
jumping into a group of mostly stationary players,
●
diving around or through a player that results in contact with a player’s back
or legs,
●
running without looking, when there is a likelihood of other players occupying
the space into which the player is traveling,
●
jumping or otherwise leaving the ground where it is likely that a significant
collision will result,
●
wild or uncontrolled throwing motions,
●
initiating contact with a player’s head,
●
initiating contact with an airborne player’s lower body that prevents them from
landing on their feet, and
●
jumping right in front of a sprinting player in a manner where contact is
unavoidable]]
    - **20.B.1.** Dangerous play is considered a foul regardless of whether or when the disc arrives
      <!-- rule: 20.B.1 source: usau -->
or contact occurs.
      - **20.B.1.a.** In general, a dangerous play call may only be made if at least some
        <!-- rule: 20.B.1.a source: usau -->
amount of contact between the involved players occurred, and the vast
majority of dangerous play will involve contact between players. However,
when the other criteria of Rule 20.B are met, contact is not required for a
player to invoke this rule where there is near certainty that significant
contact would have occurred had the player not taken last moment steps
to avoid contact.  [[A player is not required to hold their position and
receive contact in order to call “dangerous play,” but the mere possibility
of contact is insufficient to justify a call. Furthermore, if the offending
player stops or changes their path such that contact would not have
occurred, contact was not “nearly certain.”]][[For example, a “no-contact
dangerous play” may be called by a player who is standing under a
floating disc and sees an opponent recklessly barreling towards them,
and moves out of that space at the last moment, when it is clear that
otherwise a collision will almost certainly occur. Even if no contact occurs
(as a result of the successful dodge), the dangerous play call is permitted
in this type of exceptional circumstance. In contrast, if a player is vying for
unoccupied space, but decides not to enter the space for fear of possible
or likely contact with an opponent also moving into that space, the player
may not call a dangerous play if no contact actually occurred. In most
cases, if an opponent moves through a space that a player never
occupied and no contact occurs, a dangerous play cannot be called.
However, even the slightest contact satisfies the contact requirement of
this rule.]]
    - **20.B.2.** Resolution. If uncontested, a call of “dangerous play” is resolved as an analogous
      <!-- rule: 20.B.2 source: usau -->
foul (e.g., if the call occurred while or immediately after the calling player was making
a play on a disc in the air, it is treated as a Receiving Foul (20.E.2)). A player called
for dangerous play may contest the call if they believe the call was incorrect (17.B).
      - **20.B.2.a.** Dangerous play between a thrower and marker is treated as a throwing
        <!-- rule: 20.B.2.a source: usau -->
foul that affected the play, regardless of whether or when the disc is
released or when contact occurs, unless the calling player determines
otherwise.
      - **20.B.2.b.** Dangerous play occurring when or immediately after the disc is in the air
        <!-- rule: 20.B.2.b source: usau -->
is treated as a receiving foul if either player involved is attempting a play
on the disc. However, the calling player may elect to treat the dangerous
play as a general foul, if the player determines that the dangerous play
was unrelated to the overall play that decided the outcome of the action.
[[For example, if a third player appears and grabs the disc far before it
reaches the two involved players, or if the disc is thrown to the opposite
side of the field, the involved players will not be attempting a play on the
disc. However, if multiple players accumulate under a floating disc, one
player’s dangerous play will be treated as a receiving foul, even if a third
player happens to make a successful play on the disc, as the players
under the disc were attempting a play on the disc. The calling player
would have discretion to deem the third player’s play so independent and
removed from the involved players that the calling player wishes to treat
the dangerous play as a general foul rather than a receiving foul. In
general, a calling player’s decision that a dangerous play was unrelated
to the overall play will be based on the dangerous play being removed in
significant distance or time from the overall play. By way of further
example, even a dangerous play committed against a player unaware of
the approaching disc will be treated as a receiving foul, where the
offending player was attempting to make a play on the disc, giving the
benefit of the doubt that the calling player could potentially have become
aware of the approaching disc, had the offending player made a safe
play. In this instance, the calling player could determine that it would not
have been possible to become aware of the disc such that the outcome of
the play would have changed and therefore elect to treat the dangerous
play as a general foul.]]
      - **20.B.2.c.** Dangerous play is treated as a general foul only if it occurs when the disc
        <!-- rule: 20.B.2.c source: usau -->
is not in the air, occurs far away from the disc, when the disc is obviously
uncatchable, or when the calling player has elected such treatment under
      - **20.B.2.b.** In this situation, the calling player determines whether the play
        <!-- rule: 20.B.2.b source: usau -->
was affected, under the standard enunciated in this rule and its
annotations.  [[A disc is obviously uncatchable only when it hits the ground
before a catch could possibly be made, is out-of-bounds with no
possibility of an in-bounds completion, or otherwise presents no
opportunity for a catch (whether initial or subsequent efforts), giving every
benefit of the doubt to the calling player.]] [[In determining whether a
dangerous play affected the play under 20.B.2.c, the calling player should
broadly consider the entire play, including any approach taken by the
offending player immediately before the dangerous play. A good rule of
thumb is to look to the last time when a player could have still changed
their actions and actively avoided a dangerous outcome but did not (the
“point of no return”) through the time immediately after resolution of the
play and broadly consider whether the outcome of the play could possibly
have been different, had the offending player taken a safe approach.
Even a player’s awareness of the presence of the offending player can
affect the play.]]
### 20.C. A foul can be called only by the fouled player and must be announced by loudly calling “foul”
<!-- rule: 20.C source: usau -->

immediately after it occurs.
### 20.D. Non-incidental contact resulting from adjacent opposing players vying for the same
<!-- rule: 20.D source: usau -->

unoccupied position may be treated as offsetting fouls.
### 20.E. Some fouls carry some extra provisions, as listed below.
<!-- rule: 20.E source: usau -->

    - **20.E.1.** Throwing Fouls:
      <!-- rule: 20.E.1 source: usau -->
      - **20.E.1.a.** A throwing foul may be called when there is non-incidental contact
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.a source: usau -->
between the thrower and marker.  [[Nearly every instance of contact
between the thrower and marker will be non-incidental with respect to the
thrower, whether it disrupts the thrower’s concentration, interferes with
the thrower’s movement, disturbs the thrower's grip, interferes with a
throw, or affects continued play in any other way.]]  The disc in a thrower's
possession is considered part of the thrower.
      - **20.E.1.b.** In general, any contact between the thrower and the extended (i.e., away
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.b source: usau -->
from the midline of the body) arms or legs of a marker is a foul on the
marker, unless the contacted area of the marker is completely stationary
and in a legal position.  [[Really completely stationary. This is very rare.]]
      - **20.E.1.c.** Any contact that occurs due to the marker setting up in an illegal position
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.c source: usau -->
(16.H) is a foul on the marker.  [[Nearly all contact will be non-incidental
with respect to the thrower.]]  This contact must be part of an
ultimate-related maneuver (throwing, pivoting, etc.) and must occur with a
part of the marker that is illegally positioned.  [[For example, shoving the
marker does not result in contact due to the marker setting up an illegal
position. Similarly, if a marker is providing disc space, except for illegally
wrapping the thrower with their arms, only contact with the illegally
positioned arms is due to the marker setting up an illegal position.]]  Once
the marker has set up in a legal marking position, it is the responsibility of
both players to respect this legal position. However, contact resulting from
the thrower and the marker both vying for the same unoccupied position
is a foul on the marker.
      - **20.E.1.d.** Any contact initiated by a thrower with the body (excluding arms and legs
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.d source: usau -->
extended from the midline of the body) of a legally positioned (16.H)
marker is a foul on the thrower.  [[Non-incidental contact. The effect of the
contact on the marker is important here, as many, but not all, instances of
contact will affect continued play with respect to the marker.]]
      - **20.E.1.e.** Although it should be avoided whenever possible, incidental contact
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.e source: usau -->
occurring during the follow-through (after the disc is released) is not a
foul.  [[Remember, even if the contact were non-incidental, because it
occurred after the throw was released, it cannot be deemed to have
affected the specific play, and a turnover will stand.]]
      - **20.E.1.f.** If non-incidental contact occurs between the thrower and marker such
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.f source: usau -->
that the thrower could call a throwing foul on the marker, the thrower may
instead choose to call “contact.” Play does not stop and the marker
resumes the stall count at “one.” Other than resetting the stall count, the
“contact” call is resolved in the same manner as a marking violation (16).
The marker may contest the “contact” call by calling “violation,” which is
treated as the call of an offensive violation. If the thrower calls “contact”
after beginning the throwing motion and subsequently releases the disc, it
is treated as if the thrower called “foul.”
      - **20.E.1.g.** Any references above to a marker also apply to any defensive player
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.g source: usau -->
within ten feet of the thrower's pivot.
      - **20.E.1.h.** Before a thrower has established a pivot, application of throwing foul
        <!-- rule: 20.E.1.h source: usau -->
protections are limited to contact during the throwing motion and related
windups. Instead, the general foul rules and responsibility to avoid
contact will apply, and the player initiating non-incidental contact will
generally have committed the foul, with the exception of blocking fouls
(20.E.3).  [[For example, contact initiated by a thrower with a marker's
extended, moving arm would generally be a foul on the marker. However,
contact initiated by a receiver immediately after a catch with a defender's
extended arm is generally not a foul on that defender if a pivot is not set
and the contact is not part of a windup or throwing motion. Another
example: a receiver who jumps, catches a disc, and initiates contact with
a nearby defender on the way down, losing possession of the disc,
cannot call a foul or strip on the basis that the defender was an illegally
positioned marker.]]
    - **20.E.2.** Receiving Fouls:
      <!-- rule: 20.E.2 source: usau -->
      - **20.E.2.a.** If a player contacts an opponent while the disc is in the air and thereby
        <!-- rule: 20.E.2.a source: usau -->
interferes with that opponent's attempt to make a play on the disc, that
player has committed a receiving foul. Some amount of incidental contact
before, during, or immediately after the attempt often is unavoidable and
is not a foul.  [[The opponent must at least begin an attempt to make a
play on the disc. The opponent’s "attempt to make a play on the disc"
includes any second efforts after a disc is tipped, if the disc has not
become uncatchable.]][[Incidental contact, by definition, is not a foul.]]
      - **20.E.2.b.** If 17.C.3.b.1 or 17.C.4.a.1 of the Continuation Rule applies: if the call is
        <!-- rule: 20.E.2.b source: usau -->
uncontested, the fouled player gains possession at the spot on the
playing field closest to the spot of the infraction. If the foul is contested,
the disc reverts to the thrower.
      - **20.E.2.c.** The Principle of Verticality: All players have the right to enter the air
        <!-- rule: 20.E.2.c source: usau -->
space immediately above their torso to make a play on a thrown disc. If
non-incidental contact occurs in the airspace immediately above a player
before the outcome of the play is determined (e.g., before possession is
gained or an incomplete pass is effected), it is a foul on the player
entering the vertical space of the other player.  [[If the disc is caught (or
rendered uncatchable) before contact occurs, then the outcome of the
play is determined already and the contact is not an infraction of this
rule.]]
      - **20.E.2.d.** Force-out Foul: If an airborne player catches the disc and is contacted by
        <!-- rule: 20.E.2.d source: usau -->
an opposing player before landing, and that contact causes the player to
land out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds, or out of the end zone instead of
in the end zone, it is a foul on the opposing player and the fouled player
retains possession at the spot of the foul. If an uncontested force-out foul
results in an in-bounds player landing outside the end zone being
attacked when they would have landed in the end zone without the foul, a
goal is awarded.
    - **20.E.3.** Blocking Fouls:
      <!-- rule: 20.E.3 source: usau -->
      - **20.E.3.a.** When the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to
        <!-- rule: 20.E.3.a source: usau -->
prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc  and any
resulting non-incidental contact is a foul on the blocking player which is
treated like a receiving foul (20.E.2).  [[Solely. The intent of the player’s
movement can be partly motivated to prevent an opponent from taking an
unoccupied path to the disc, so long as it is part of a general effort to
make a play on the disc. Note, if a trailing player runs into a player in front
of them, it is nearly always a foul on the trailing player.]]
      - **20.E.3.b.** A player may not take a position that is unavoidable by a moving
        <!-- rule: 20.E.3.b source: usau -->
opponent when time, distance, and line of sight are considered.  [[If you
are already in a position, you maintaining that position is not "taking a
position."]]  Non-incidental contact resulting from taking such a position is
a foul on the blocking player.
    - **20.E.4.** Strip: If a foul causes a player to lose possession of the disc, it is a strip. A strip is a
      <!-- rule: 20.E.4 source: usau -->
subset of fouls and is treated the same way.  [[Initiating contact with a disc in a
player’s possession is a foul.]] [[Sustained contact with, and control of, a
non-spinning disc is required to establish possession (3.J). A player may not call a
strip if they had only momentary contact with or lacked control of the disc at the time
of an opponent contacting the disc because the player did not have possession.]]
