## 17. Making and Resolving Calls

<!-- section: 17 source: usau -->

### 17.A. Unless specified differently elsewhere, an infraction may only be called by a player on the
<!-- rule: 17.A source: usau -->

infracted team who recognizes that it has occurred. The player must know that a specific rule
was violated and have perceived the particular action with certainty.  [[A player may not call an
infraction whenever the player merely suspects that an infraction might have occurred.]]  The
player must immediately call “violation” or the name of the specific infraction loudly.
### 17.B. A player called for an infraction may contest that call if that player believes the infraction did not
<!-- rule: 17.B source: usau -->

occur.  [[This belief may be based on the player’s perspective on the particular sequence of
events or based on a disagreement over the application of the rules, provided the player has
read and understands the rules. For example, "No, I didn’t slap your hand" or "Tipping the disc
to someone else is not a travel."]]
### 17.C. Any time an infraction is called, the Continuation Rule applies. Continuation Rule: Play stops
<!-- rule: 17.C source: usau -->

when the thrower in possession acknowledges that an infraction has been called. If a call is
made when there is no thrower in possession of the disc and the disc is not in the air (for
example, the disc is lying on the ground), play stops at the time of the call. However, if a call is
made when the disc is in the air or the thrower is in the act of throwing, or if the thrower fails to
acknowledge the call and subsequently attempts a pass, play continues until the outcome of that
pass is determined. For the purpose of the Continuation Rule, an uncontested stall that occurs
after another call is treated the same as an incomplete pass.  [[Thus, if you get stalled before you
acknowledge a call, it is treated the same as if you ignored the call and threw a turnover.]]  Play
then either stops or continues according to the following:
    - **17.C.1.** Despite any outcome dictated by these rules, if the involved players on both teams
      <!-- rule: 17.C.1 source: usau -->
agree that the infraction did not affect the outcome of the play, play stops and the
result of the play stands. This provision does not apply if the thrower is aware an
infraction has been called and subsequently attempts a pass.
    - **17.C.2.** Where the outcome of these rules is for play to continue unhalted, the player who
      <!-- rule: 17.C.2 source: usau -->
called the infraction must announce “play on.” Additionally, any player recognizing
that play should continue without stoppage should announce “play on.” If the player
who called the infraction does not announce “play on” and the opposing team is
uncertain whether play should continue, the opposing team has the option to stop
play by calling “violation.”
    - **17.C.3.** For calls made by the offense:
      <!-- rule: 17.C.3 source: usau -->
      - **17.C.3.a.** If the pass is complete:
        <!-- rule: 17.C.3.a source: usau -->
        - **17.C.3.a.1.** If the offense called the infraction before the thrower began
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.a.1 source: usau -->
the act of throwing (3.N.4), play stops and possession
reverts to the thrower.
        - **17.C.3.a.2.** If the offense called the infraction after the thrower began
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.a.2 source: usau -->
the act of throwing, play continues unhalted.
        - **17.C.3.a.3.** Where an infraction is called by the thrower, players should
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.a.3 source: usau -->
treat the call as if it was made when the infraction occurred
in determining whether the call was made before or after the
thrower was in the act of throwing. If the infraction occurred
after the throw was released, the call is considered to have
been made by a non-thrower.  [[This means that if you throw
a turnover and call a foul on contact after the release, the
turnover will generally stand. Note that the timing is based
on when the infraction occurred for this rule.]]
      - **17.C.3.b.** If the pass is incomplete:
        <!-- rule: 17.C.3.b source: usau -->
        - **17.C.3.b.1.** If the infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.b.1 source: usau -->
disc reverts to the thrower at the time the infraction occurred
unless the specific rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule) says
otherwise.
        - **17.C.3.b.2.** If the infraction did not affect the play, play stops and the
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.b.2 source: usau -->
result of the play stands.
        - **17.C.3.b.3.** Where the thrower calls an infraction which occurred before
          <!-- rule: 17.C.3.b.3 source: usau -->
the thrower began the act of throwing, play continues
unhalted and the result of the play stands.
    - **17.C.4.** For calls made by the defense:
      <!-- rule: 17.C.4 source: usau -->
      - **17.C.4.a.** If the pass is complete:
        <!-- rule: 17.C.4.a source: usau -->
        - **17.C.4.a.1.** If the infraction affected the play (17.C.5), play stops and the
          <!-- rule: 17.C.4.a.1 source: usau -->
disc reverts to the thrower at the time the infraction occurred
unless the specific rule (e.g., the receiving foul rule) says
otherwise.
        - **17.C.4.a.2.** If the infraction did not affect the play, play stops and the
          <!-- rule: 17.C.4.a.2 source: usau -->
result of the play stands.
      - **17.C.4.b.** If the pass is incomplete, play continues un-halted.
        <!-- rule: 17.C.4.b source: usau -->
    - **17.C.5.** An infraction affected the play if an infracted player determines that the outcome of
      <!-- rule: 17.C.5 source: usau -->
the specific play, from the time of the infraction until play stops, may have been
meaningfully different absent the infraction.  [[It is the infracted player’s responsibility
to announce if play was affected. For example, if a defender calls "pick" while trailing
a receiver by 6 feet, the defender should indicate whether the pick affected the play. If
the pick did not affect the play, the defender will still recover any distance lost, but the
completed pass will stand. If the pick did affect the play, the disc reverts to the
thrower.]]  For example, if a receiver is fouled and thereby prevented from getting
open for a pass, the play was affected; however, if the receiver would not have
received a pass even without the foul, the play was not affected.  [[Contact that occurs
after the outcome of the play is determined cannot affect the play. For example, if a
defender catches a disc before lightly bumping into the receiver, that contact did not
affect the play and the turnover will stand.]]
    - **17.C.6.** Positioning after a call:
      <!-- rule: 17.C.6 source: usau -->
      - **17.C.6.a.** If no pass is thrown or attempted before the thrower stops play by
        <!-- rule: 17.C.6.a source: usau -->
acknowledging the call, all players return to the locations they occupied
when the call was made.
      - **17.C.6.b.** If a pass is thrown or attempted before the thrower acknowledges the call
        <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b source: usau -->
or the call is made after the throwing attempt, and
        - **17.C.6.b.1.** if possession reverts to the thrower, all players return to the
          <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b.1 source: usau -->
locations they occupied at the earlier of:  [[Therefore, if a
long pass is thrown and there is a contested receiving foul,
the players will return to where they were at the time of the
throw (rather than remaining downfield after chasing down
the disc).]]
        - **17.C.6.b.1.** 1.  the time of the throw,
          <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b.1 source: usau -->
        - **17.C.6.b.1.** 2.  the time of the call.
          <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b.1 source: usau -->
        - **17.C.6.b.2.** if a player other than the thrower is awarded possession due
          <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b.2 source: usau -->
to an uncontested call, all players return to the locations
they occupied at the time of the infraction.
        - **17.C.6.b.3.** if the result of a play stands, players return to the locations
          <!-- rule: 17.C.6.b.3 source: usau -->
they occupied when play stopped. In addition, an infracted
player is then allowed to move to recover the relative
position lost because of the infraction.
### 17.D. When a call is made, throwers must stop play by visibly or audibly communicating the stoppage
<!-- rule: 17.D source: usau -->

as soon as they are aware of the call.  [[Players should  echo calls on the field.]]  [[If the marker
has made reasonable efforts to notify the thrower of a call and believes that the thrower has not
stopped play promptly enough, the marker may call a violation under this rule and a completed
pass will come back to the thrower.]]
### 17.E. If it is unclear whether a catch was made before the disc contacted the ground, or whether a
<!-- rule: 17.E source: usau -->

player's first point of ground contact after catching the disc was in- or out-of-bounds or in or out
of the end zone, the player with the best perspective makes the call.
### 17.F. If a player makes a play-halting call and subsequently determines that their call was incorrect,
<!-- rule: 17.F source: usau -->

they should retract the call by announcing “retracted.” Play still stops. Play restarts with a check
and the stall resumes according to 15.F.1.  [[This includes a player incorrectly stopping play
because they thought they heard a call such as "pick" and echoed the call.]]
### 17.G. If a dispute arises concerning an infraction or the outcome of a play (e.g., a catch where no one
<!-- rule: 17.G source: usau -->

had a good perspective), and the teams cannot come to a satisfactory resolution, play stops,
and the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check (10.D.3), with the count
reached plus one or at six if over five.
### 17.H. If an infraction results in possession reverting to a thrower who was airborne when releasing the
<!-- rule: 17.H source: usau -->

disc, play restarts at the spot on the playing field closest to the point of release.  [[This applies to
throwers attempting a "greatest" or any other airborne thrower.]]
### 17.I. If multiple calls occur on the same play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved in
<!-- rule: 17.I source: usau -->

reverse sequence (latest call first, earliest call last).
    - **17.I.1.** If an earlier infraction is determined not to have affected the play (17.C.1 and 17.C.5),
      <!-- rule: 17.I.1 source: usau -->
or is retracted (17.F), that infraction is not resolved and it does not affect the
resolution of subsequent infractions.  [[Not resolved essentially means that the call is
treated as if it had not occurred and the result of the play (possession, stall count,
etc.) is unchanged by that call.]]
    - **17.I.2.** Offsetting infractions: If both offensive and defensive infractions occur simultaneously
      <!-- rule: 17.I.2 source: usau -->
or the sequence cannot be determined, the resolution for this set of infractions is: the
disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check, with the count reached
plus one or at six if over five.  [[It is possible that resolutions to earlier infractions may
ultimately change this particular outcome.]]
    - **17.I.3.** Exception: If separate fouls occur while the disc is in the air, but before any player
      <!-- rule: 17.I.3 source: usau -->
starts to attempt to catch or block the disc, those fouls are treated as simultaneous
and on the same play.
[[Examples:
1. A receiver and their opponent contact each other and both call fouls against the other. 17.I.2
applies, and the disc is returned to the thrower and put into play with a check, with the count
reached plus one or at six if over five.
