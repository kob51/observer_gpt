## 18. Travels

<!-- section: 18 source: usau -->

### 18.A. After catching a pass, a player is required to come to a stop as quickly as possible and establish
<!-- rule: 18.A source: usau -->

a pivot.
### 18.B. If a player catches the disc while running or jumping, the player may release a pass without
<!-- rule: 18.B source: usau -->

attempting to stop and without setting a pivot, provided the player does not speed up or change
direction while in possession of the disc and releases a pass before three additional points of
ground contact occur, provided that all points of ground contact are completely in-bounds,
excluding their attacking end zone. (crosslink exception).
### 18.C. A player may bobble the disc in order to gain control of it.
<!-- rule: 18.C source: usau -->

### 18.D. The following are travels:
<!-- rule: 18.D source: usau -->

    - **18.D.1.** The thrower fails to establish and continually maintain a pivot at the appropriate spot on
      <!-- rule: 18.D.1 source: usau -->
the field until the throw is released.  [[Remember that according to 17.A, a player must
perceive that this infraction has occurred in order to make a call. In most cases, it is
unreasonable for a marker to recognize an infraction concerning a small toe-drag during
the release of a throw since this would require the marker to simultaneously perceive
both the toe-drag and the release. To ensure accuracy, defenders should err toward
allowing play to continue if the drag causing the travel is less than two inches.]] [[In
addition, remember that a player must only make a call where the infraction is significant
enough to affect play (2.D.2).]]
    - **18.D.2.** The thrower fails to touch the disc to the ground when required.
      <!-- rule: 18.D.2 source: usau -->
    - **18.D.3.** An offensive player advances in any direction an in-bounds disc that is rolling,
      <!-- rule: 18.D.3 source: usau -->
sliding, or sitting on the ground.
      - **18.D.3.a.** If the defense commits this infraction, the thrower may inform the defense
        <!-- rule: 18.D.3.a source: usau -->
of the infraction without stopping play. The thrower must indicate where
the infraction occurred and put the disc into play at that spot.
    - **18.D.4.** A player catches the disc and either does not stop as quickly as possible, speeds up,
      <!-- rule: 18.D.4 source: usau -->
or changes direction before establishing a pivot.
    - **18.D.5.** A player purposefully bobbles the disc (including tipping, delaying, guiding, brushing,
      <!-- rule: 18.D.5 source: usau -->
or the like) to oneself in order to advance the disc in any direction from where it
initially was contacted.  [[Tipping, brushing, etc. to someone else is legal. It is legal to
tip/brush your own throw. However, if after a tip/brush, a player is the first player to
touch the disc, then it is deemed a tip/brush to themself and it is a travel.]][[A player
may bobble the disc in order to gain control of it (18.C).]]
      - **18.D.5.a.** If a defender commits this infraction on a disc in flight and the result of the
        <!-- rule: 18.D.5.a source: usau -->
play is the defender or the defender’s team gaining possession, the
defender gains or retains possession at the initial spot of the infraction and
becomes the thrower.
### 18.E. Exceptions:
<!-- rule: 18.E source: usau -->

    - **18.E.1.** If a non-standing player loses contact with the pivot spot in order to stand up, it is not
      <!-- rule: 18.E.1 source: usau -->
a travel, provided the new pivot is established at the same location.
    - **18.E.2.** It is not a travel if a player catches the disc while running or jumping, does not speed
      <!-- rule: 18.E.2 source: usau -->
up or change direction while in possession of the disc, and releases a pass before
three additional points of ground contact occur, provided that all points of ground
contact are completely in-bounds, excluding their attacking end zone. In this
instance, a player is not required to establish a pivot or stop as quickly as possible.
    - **18.E.3.** If play stops, the thrower may reset the pivot.
      <!-- rule: 18.E.3 source: usau -->
### 18.F. Resolutions:
<!-- rule: 18.F source: usau -->

    - **18.F.1.** If the travel occurs and a pass is thrown:
      <!-- rule: 18.F.1 source: usau -->
      - **18.F.1.a.** If the pass is incomplete, play continues uninterrupted (as per the
        <!-- rule: 18.F.1.a source: usau -->
Continuation Rule, 17.C.4.b).
      - **18.F.1.b.** If the pass is complete, play stops and the disc is returned to the thrower
        <!-- rule: 18.F.1.b source: usau -->
where the travel occurred (as per the Continuation Rule, 17.C.4.a.1). Play
restarts with a check.  [[The spot where the travel occurred is the spot on
the field where the thrower’s pivot would have been had they not
traveled.]]
        - **18.F.1.b.1.** If the thrower threw from either the end zone or
          <!-- rule: 18.F.1.b.1 source: usau -->
out-of-bounds, and their pivot was more than one step from
the appropriate spot, the following procedure is used instead:
First, the disc is checked in where the thrower threw the
pass, making it live, then the thrower walks to the appropriate
spot for their pivot and puts the disc in play.  [[At this point, the
stall count may resume.]]
    - **18.F.2.** If the travel occurs and no pass has been attempted:
      <!-- rule: 18.F.2 source: usau -->
      - **18.F.2.a.** Play does not stop. The defense (typically the marker) points to the spot
        <!-- rule: 18.F.2.a source: usau -->
where the travel occurred, and the thrower returns to that spot without
delay. The thrower must touch the disc to the ground before attempting a
legal pass.  [[Play does not stop, but the disc is live, so it is still subject to a
turnover (for example if the thrower drops it).]]
      - **18.F.2.b.** The stall count is paused until the thrower sets a pivot where the travel
        <!-- rule: 18.F.2.b source: usau -->
occurred. The marker is not required to say “stalling” when resuming the
count if they previously initiated the stall count by saying “stalling” prior to
calling travel. The thrower must touch the disc to the ground before
attempting a pass.
      - **18.F.2.c.** If the thrower wishes to contest the travel call, they announce “violation”
        <!-- rule: 18.F.2.c source: usau -->
and play stops. Upon checking the disc in, the stall count resumes at the
count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5 (15.F.1.c).  [[If the defense does not
indicate to the thrower where the travel occurred, or the thrower wishes to
contest the location of an indicated spot, the thrower should announce
“violation”, stopping play, and explain that the spot was incorrectly/not
indicated. After setting their pivot in the correct spot, and checking the disc
in, the stall count resumes at the count reached plus 1, or 6 if over 5
(15.F.1.c).]]
