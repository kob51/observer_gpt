## Preface

Ultimate is a sport that inspires players and fans alike because of its ability to develop and showcase the
athleticism, skill, teamwork, and character of its participants. The arc of the disc in flight, the opportunity
for each individual to contribute equally to their team’s success, and the trust given to each player to know
and uphold the rules make ultimate a sport that is embraced for its fun and excitement on the field and for
the community beyond it. As a low-cost sport requiring minimal equipment, offering single and
mixed-gender play, and providing a format that builds communication and conflict resolution skills,
ultimate provides a welcoming, high value experience for players and fans from a diverse set of
backgrounds and experiences. The Official Rules of Ultimate 2026-2027 describes how the game is
played, including how players self-officiate and apply the principles of Spirit of the Game in competition.
