## 16. Marking Violations

<!-- section: 16 source: usau -->

### 16.A. Marking violations are infractions committed against the thrower by the marker or another
<!-- rule: 16.A source: usau -->

defensive player close to the thrower, as outlined below.
### 16.B. Only the thrower may call a marking violation, and to do so must call out the name of the
<!-- rule: 16.B source: usau -->

specific marking violation.
### 16.C. When a marking violation is called, play does not stop. The violation must be corrected before
<!-- rule: 16.C source: usau -->

the marker can resume the stall count with the number last uttered before the call minus one
(e.g., “stalling one...two...three…” “fast count” ”...two...three…”). If the marker resumes the
stall count before the defense corrects a marking violation, it is another instance of the
original marking violation, which may be called by the thrower.
### 16.D. If the defense commits a marking violation after being called for a marking violation during the
<!-- rule: 16.D source: usau -->

same stall count (15.B) but before the thrower is in the act of throwing, the thrower may
choose to either call another marking violation or to treat the marking violation as a general
defensive violation (17). To treat it as a general violation, the thrower must call “violation.”
### 16.E. Marking violations are:  Fast count, double team, disc space, straddle, wrapping, and vision
<!-- rule: 16.E source: usau -->

blocking.
### 16.F. Fast count:
<!-- rule: 16.F source: usau -->

    - **16.F.1.** If the marker does not say “stalling” to initiate or resume a stall count, counts at
      <!-- rule: 16.F.1 source: usau -->
intervals of less than one second, or skips a number in the count, it is a fast count.
    - **16.F.2.** If a fast count occurs in such a manner that the thrower does not have a reasonable
      <!-- rule: 16.F.2 source: usau -->
opportunity to call fast count before the first utterance of the word ten, the play is
treated as a contested stall (15.D.2).
    - **16.F.3.** If this (16.F.2) occurs in the same possession following a contested stall (either due
      <!-- rule: 16.F.3 source: usau -->
to 16.F.1 or 15.D.2), the stall count resumes at six.
### 16.G. Double team: If a defensive player other than the marker is within 10 feet of any pivot of the
<!-- rule: 16.G source: usau -->

thrower without also being within 10 feet of and guarding (3.D) another offensive player, it is a
double team. However, merely running across this area is not a double team.  [["Merely
running" means running for the exclusive purpose of reaching the other side. Running with an
ulterior motive of interfering with the thrower in any way is not "merely running" and is a
double team.]]
### 16.H. Disc space:
<!-- rule: 16.H source: usau -->

    - **16.H.1.** It is a disc space violation if:
      <!-- rule: 16.H.1 source: usau -->
      - **16.H.1.a.** any part of the marker is less than one disc diameter away from the torso of
        <!-- rule: 16.H.1.a source: usau -->
the thrower; or
      - **16.H.1.b.** a line between any two points on the marker
        <!-- rule: 16.H.1.b source: usau -->
        - **16.H.1.b.1.** touches the thrower; or
          <!-- rule: 16.H.1.b.1 source: usau -->
        - **16.H.1.b.2.** is less than one disc diameter away from the torso or pivot of
          <!-- rule: 16.H.1.b.2 source: usau -->
the thrower.
    - **16.H.2.** Straddle: If a line between the marker’s feet is less than one disc diameter away from
      <!-- rule: 16.H.2 source: usau -->
the pivot of the thrower, it is a straddle violation.
    - **16.H.3.** Wrapping: If a line between the marker’s hands is less than one disc diameter away
      <!-- rule: 16.H.3 source: usau -->
from the torso or pivot of the thrower, it is a wrapping violation.
    - **16.H.4.** The thrower may choose to call “disc space” for both straddle and wrapping violations
      <!-- rule: 16.H.4 source: usau -->
as they are a subset of disc space violations.  [[However, the thrower may also choose
to call the more specific violation for clearer communication to the marker about what
needs to be corrected.]]
    - **16.H.5.** However, if any of the above situations are caused solely by movement of the
      <!-- rule: 16.H.5 source: usau -->
thrower, it is not a violation.
### 16.I. Vision blocking: If the marker deliberately blocks the thrower's vision, it is a vision blocking
<!-- rule: 16.I source: usau -->

violation.
### 16.J. The marker may contest a marking violation by calling “violation.” This contest is treated as
<!-- rule: 16.J source: usau -->

the call of an offensive violation, and the Continuation Rule (17.C) applies.  [[It is the marker’s
responsibility to announce if play was affected for the purpose of the Continuation Rule
(17.C). Generally speaking, due to 17.J, calls made by another player cannot be said to affect
play. However, in limited situations for contested marking violation calls, when the marker
diverts their attention away from marking while reasonably and quickly assessing the
conditions to the thrower’s marking violation call, the marker could determine that play was
affected. For example, the thrower calls straddle, and while the marker is looking at their feet
to assess their marking position, the thrower completes a throw around the marker. If the
marker subsequently contests the straddle because they assessed that they weren't
committing a marking violation, they could claim that play was affected and the disc should be
returned to the thrower. It is the thrower’s responsibility to stop play as soon as possible after
the marker makes their call contesting the marking violation (17.D).]]
### 16.K. Flagrant marking infractions are immediately callable as a general violation and are also
<!-- rule: 16.K source: usau -->

covered under 2.C.1.  [[One example of a flagrant marking infraction would be skipping
multiple numbers or intervals at a time in a stall count.]]
