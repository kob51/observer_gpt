## 11. In- and Out-of-bounds

<!-- section: 11 source: usau -->

### 11.A. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are
<!-- rule: 11.A source: usau -->

out-of-bounds.
### 11.B. The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact
<!-- rule: 11.B source: usau -->

(direct or indirect) with it except for players. Any non-players other than observers are
considered part of the out-of-bounds area. A disc does not change in- or out-of-bounds status
when contacted by an observer.
### 11.C. A player contacting the out-of-bounds area is out-of-bounds. A player who is not out-of-bounds
<!-- rule: 11.C source: usau -->

is in-bounds. An airborne player retains in-bounds or out-of-bounds status until that player
contacts the playing field or the out-of-bounds area. The following exceptions apply:
    - **11.C.1.** If momentum carries a player out-of-bounds after landing in-bounds with possession
      <!-- rule: 11.C.1 source: usau -->
of an in-bounds disc, the player is considered in-bounds. For this exception to apply,
that player's first point of ground contact with any area must be completely in-bounds.
The disc is put into play at the spot on the edge of the playing field where the player
first went out-of-bounds (unless 12.A.2 applies). If the player traversed the end zone
being attacked, 12.B applies.
    - **11.C.2.** A thrower who has established a pivot may contact an out-of-bounds area while
      <!-- rule: 11.C.2 source: usau -->
pivoting and is considered in-bounds while in possession of the disc.
    - **11.C.3.** Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from
      <!-- rule: 11.C.3 source: usau -->
one to another.
    - **11.C.4.** If a player catches an in-bounds disc and would reasonably have been able to land
      <!-- rule: 11.C.4 source: usau -->
in-bounds, but lands on an opposing player in a way that causes their first ground
contact to be out-of-bounds, this is to be treated as a force-out foul and 20.E.2.d
applies. For this exception to apply, the play resulting in the landing contact cannot be
construed as a dangerous play.  [[In this case, calls will be resolved in chronological
order with the dangerous play superseding the force-out foul.]]
### 11.D. A disc becomes in-bounds when it is put into play, or when play starts or restarts.
<!-- rule: 11.D source: usau -->

### 11.E. A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area, contacts an
<!-- rule: 11.E source: usau -->

out-of-bounds offensive player, or is caught by an out-of-bounds defensive player.
### 11.F. The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go
<!-- rule: 11.F source: usau -->

out-of-bounds to make a play on the disc.
### 11.G. If an in-bounds defender gains possession while airborne and becomes out-of-bounds while still
<!-- rule: 11.G source: usau -->

in possession of the disc, the play is treated as if the defender was out-of-bounds when
possession was gained (11.E).
### 11.H. To continue play after the disc becomes out-of-bounds, a member of the team gaining
<!-- rule: 11.H source: usau -->

possession of the disc must carry it to, and put it into play at, the spot on the central zone
nearest to where the most recent of the following events occurred:
    - **11.H.1.** the disc completely crossed the inside of the perimeter line;
      <!-- rule: 11.H.1 source: usau -->
    - **11.H.2.** the disc contacted an in-bounds player;
      <!-- rule: 11.H.2 source: usau -->
    - **11.H.3.** the disc contacted a defensive player; or
      <!-- rule: 11.H.3 source: usau -->
    - **11.H.4.** the disc became out-of-bounds due to contact with the out-of-bounds area or a player
      <!-- rule: 11.H.4 source: usau -->
while any part of the disc was inside the perimeter line.
After establishing a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, the thrower must touch the disc to
the ground before putting it into play (10.C).
### 11.I. Events occurring after the disc becomes out-of-bounds do not affect where it is put into play.
