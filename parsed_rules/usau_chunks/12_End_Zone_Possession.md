## 12. End Zone Possession

<!-- section: 12 source: usau -->

### 12.A. If a turnover results in a team gaining possession in the end zone that they are defending, the
<!-- rule: 12.A source: usau -->

player in possession must immediately either:
    - **12.A.1.** establish a pivot at the spot of the disc (to fake a throw or pause after gaining
      <!-- rule: 12.A.1 source: usau -->
possession commits the player to put the disc into play at that spot); or
    - **12.A.2.** carry the disc directly to the closest point on the goal line and put it into play at that
      <!-- rule: 12.A.2 source: usau -->
spot. If this option is chosen, the player taking possession must put the disc into play
at the goal line.  [[The player may carry the disc at any speed, constant or variable,
while not unreasonably delaying.]]  Failure to do so is a travel.
### 12.B. If a team gains or retains possession in the end zone that they are attacking other than by
<!-- rule: 12.B source: usau -->

scoring a goal in accordance with rule 13, the player in possession must carry the disc directly
to, and put it into play at, the spot on the goal line closest to where the player stopped.
### 12.C. If a team gains or retains possession of a dead disc in the end zone that they are attacking, the
<!-- rule: 12.C source: usau -->

disc is checked into a live state where the infraction occurred, and the thrower then proceeds
according to 12.B.  [[For example, after an uncontested receiving foul.]]
