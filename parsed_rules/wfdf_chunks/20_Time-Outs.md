## 20. Time-Outs

<!-- section: 20 source: wfdf -->

### 20.1. The player calling a time-out must form a "T" with their hands, or with one hand and the disc, and should
<!-- rule: 20.1 source: wfdf -->

call "time-out" to opposition players.
### 20.2. After the start of a point and before both teams have signalled readiness, a player from either team may
<!-- rule: 20.2 source: wfdf -->

call a time-out. The time-out extends the time between the start of the point and subsequent pull by
seventy-five (75) seconds.
### 20.3. After the pull only a thrower with possession of the disc may call a time-out. The time-out starts when
<!-- rule: 20.3 source: wfdf -->

the “T” is formed, and lasts seventy-five (75) seconds. After such a time-out:
      - **20.3.1.** Substitutions are not allowed, except for injury.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.2.** Play is restarted at the pivot location.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.3.** The thrower must remain the same.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.4.** All other offensive players must establish a stationary position, at any location.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.5.** Once the offensive players have selected positions, defensive players must then establish a
        <!-- rule: 20.3.5 source: wfdf -->
stationary position, at any location.
      - **20.3.6.** The stall count restarts at maximum nine (9). However if the marker has been switched, the stall
        <!-- rule: 20.3.6 source: wfdf -->
count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”.
### 20.4. If the thrower attempts to call a time-out while play is live and when their team has no remaining time-
<!-- rule: 20.4 source: wfdf -->

outs, play is stopped. The marker must add two (2) seconds to the stall count they would have restarted
play on before restarting play with a check. If this results in a stall count of ten (10) or above, this is a
"stall-out" turnover.
