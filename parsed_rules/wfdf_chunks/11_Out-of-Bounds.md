## 11. Out-of-Bounds

<!-- section: 11 source: wfdf -->

### 11.1. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.1 source: wfdf -->

bounds. All non-players are part of the out-of-bounds area.
### 11.2. The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it,
<!-- rule: 11.2 source: wfdf -->

except for defensive players, who are always considered “in-bounds”.
### 11.3. An offensive player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds.
<!-- rule: 11.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **11.3.1.** An airborne player retains their in-bounds/out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the
        <!-- rule: 11.3.1 source: wfdf -->
playing field or the out-of-bounds area.
      - **11.3.2.** A player who has caught the disc, who contacts the playing field and then contacts an out-of-
        <!-- rule: 11.3.2 source: wfdf -->
bounds area, is still considered in-bounds, as long as they maintain the catch until they establish
possession.
        - **11.3.2.1.** If they leave the playing field, they must establish a pivot point at the location on the playing
          <!-- rule: 11.3.2.1 source: wfdf -->
field where they crossed the perimeter line (unless 14.3 is in effect).
      - **11.3.3.** A thrower who contacts an out-of-bounds area is considered in-bounds until they make a pass.
        <!-- rule: 11.3.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.3.4.** Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from one to
        <!-- rule: 11.3.4 source: wfdf -->
another.
### 11.4. The following are out-of-bounds turnovers, and no catch is deemed to have occurred:
<!-- rule: 11.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **11.4.1.** any part of an offensive receiver is out-of-bounds when they contact the disc; or
        <!-- rule: 11.4.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.4.2.** after catching the disc while airborne, an offensive receiver’s first contact is out-of-bounds while
        <!-- rule: 11.4.2 source: wfdf -->
still in contact with the disc.
### 11.5. A disc is in-bounds once play is live, or when play starts or restarts.
<!-- rule: 11.5 source: wfdf -->

### 11.6. A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area or contacts an out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.6 source: wfdf -->

bounds offensive player. A disc that has been caught by an offensive player has the same in/out-of-bounds
status as that player. If the disc is simultaneously caught by more than one offensive player, one of them
being out-of-bounds, the disc is out-of-bounds.
### 11.7. The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.7 source: wfdf -->

bounds to make a play on the disc.
### 11.8. The place where a disc went out-of-bounds is the location where, prior to contacting an out-of-bounds
<!-- rule: 11.8 source: wfdf -->

area or player, the disc was most recently:
      - **11.8.1.** partly or wholly over the playing field; or
        <!-- rule: 11.8.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.8.2.** contacted by an in-bounds player.
        <!-- rule: 11.8.2 source: wfdf -->
### 11.9. If the disc is out-of-bounds and more than three (3) metres from the pivot location, non-players may
<!-- rule: 11.9 source: wfdf -->

retrieve the disc. The thrower must carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the playing field.
