## 16. Continuation after a Call

<!-- section: 16 source: wfdf -->

### 16.1. Whenever a foul or violation call is made, or a player attempts to stop play in any way, play stops
<!-- rule: 16.1 source: wfdf -->

immediately and no turnover is possible (unless in situations specified in 15.9, 16.2, and 16.3).
### 16.2. If a foul or violation:
<!-- rule: 16.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **16.2.1.** is called against the thrower and the thrower attempts a pass, or
        <!-- rule: 16.2.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.2.2.** is called by the thrower during the act of throwing, or
        <!-- rule: 16.2.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.2.3.** is called or occurs when the disc is in the air,
        <!-- rule: 16.2.3 source: wfdf -->
then play continues until possession has been established.
      - **16.2.4.** Once possession has been established:
        <!-- rule: 16.2.4 source: wfdf -->
        - **16.2.4.1.** If the team that called the foul or violation gains or retains possession as a result of the
          <!-- rule: 16.2.4.1 source: wfdf -->
pass, the play stands. Play can continue without a stoppage if the player who made the foul
or violation call makes a “Play on” call as soon as possible.
        - **16.2.4.2.** If the team that called the foul or violation does not gain or retain possession as a result of
          <!-- rule: 16.2.4.2 source: wfdf -->
the pass, play must be stopped.

          - **16.2.4.2.1.** If the team that called the foul or violation believes that possession has been affected by
            <!-- rule: 16.2.4.2.1 source: wfdf -->
the foul or violation, the disc will be returned to the thrower for a check (unless the
specific rule says otherwise).
### 16.3. Regardless of when any call is made, if the players involved from both teams agree that the event or call
<!-- rule: 16.3 source: wfdf -->

did not affect the outcome, the play stands. This rule is not superseded by any other rule.
      - **16.3.1.** If the play resulted in a goal, the goal stands.
        <!-- rule: 16.3.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.3.2.** If the play did not result in a goal the affected players may make up any positional disadvantage
        <!-- rule: 16.3.2 source: wfdf -->
caused by the event or call and restart play with a check.
