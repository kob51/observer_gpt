## 8. State of Play

<!-- section: 8 source: wfdf -->

### 8.1. Play is “dead”, and no turnover is possible:
<!-- rule: 8.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **8.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.1 source: wfdf -->
After the start of a point, until the pull is released;
      - **8.1.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.2 source: wfdf -->
When the disc must be carried to the pivot location after the pull or a turnover, until a pivot
point is established;
      - **8.1.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.3 source: wfdf -->
After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked in; or
      - **8.1.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.4 source: wfdf -->
After a disc hits the ground, until possession is established by the appropriate team.
      - **8.1.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.5 source: wfdf -->
Players are allowed to move during dead play (unless specified otherwise).
### 8.2. Play that is not dead is “live”.
<!-- rule: 8.2 source: wfdf -->

### 8.3. The thrower may not transfer possession of the disc during dead play to another player.
<!-- rule: 8.3 source: wfdf -->

### 8.4. Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the ground.
<!-- rule: 8.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **8.4.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.4.1 source: wfdf -->
If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly alters the disc’s position, the opposition
may request that the pivot point be established at the location where the disc was contacted.
### 8.5. After a turnover, and after the pull, an offensive player must move at walking pace or faster to directly
<!-- rule: 8.5 source: wfdf -->

retrieve the disc and establish a pivot point.
      - **8.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.1 source: wfdf -->
In addition to 8.5, after a turnover the thrower must establish a pivot point within the following
time limits, if the disc did not become out-of-bounds, and the disc’s location is:
        - **8.5.1.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.1.1 source: wfdf -->
in the central zone – within ten (10) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
        - **8.5.1.2.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.1.2 source: wfdf -->
in an end zone – within twenty (20) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
      - **8.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If the offence breaches 8.5, or 8.5.1, the defence may give a warning (“Delay of Game” or using a
pre-stall for breaches of 8.5.1) or may call a “Violation”.
        - **8.5.2.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.2.1 source: wfdf -->
If, after a warning, the offence continues to breach 8.5, or 8.5.1, then 9.3.1 does not apply
and the marker may commence the stall count.
      - **8.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.3 source: wfdf -->
The defence must not move in a manner that obstructs the offence from taking possession of the
disc or establishing a pivot point.
      - **8.5.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.4 source: wfdf -->
If players cannot agree on the correct pivot location, the relevant midpoint between the two
proposed pivot locations must be used.
