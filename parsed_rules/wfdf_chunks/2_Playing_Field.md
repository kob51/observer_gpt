## 2. Playing Field

<!-- section: 2 source: wfdf -->

### 2.1. The playing field is a rectangular area with dimensions and zones as shown on Figure 1 and should be
<!-- rule: 2.1 source: wfdf -->

essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable player safety.
### 2.2. The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two (2) sidelines along the length and two
<!-- rule: 2.2 source: wfdf -->

(2) endlines along the width.
### 2.3. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.
<!-- rule: 2.3 source: wfdf -->

### 2.4. The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central
<!-- rule: 2.4 source: wfdf -->

zone.
### 2.5. The brick marks are the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1) metre lines in the central zone, located a
<!-- rule: 2.5 source: wfdf -->

distance equal to the length of the end zone away from each goal line, midway between the sidelines.
### 2.6. Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones) mark the corners of the central zone and
<!-- rule: 2.6 source: wfdf -->

the end zones.
### 2.7. The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear of movable objects. If play is
<!-- rule: 2.7 source: wfdf -->

obstructed by non-players or objects within three (3) metres of the perimeter line, any obstructed player
or thrower in possession may call “Violation”.
