<!-- section: definitions source: wfdf -->

Act of throwing
See throwing motion.
Affect the play
A breach or call affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the
outcome of the specific play may have been meaningfully different had the
breach or call not occurred.
Attacking end zone The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to score.
Best perspective
The most complete viewpoint available by a player that includes the relative
position of the disc, ground, players and line markers involved in the play.
Call
A clearly communicated statement that a foul, infraction, violation, turnover
or injury has occurred. The following terms may be used: Foul, Travel,
specific name of Marking Infraction, Violation (or specific name of Violation),
specific name of turnovers, Technical, and Injury.
Catch
A non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts.
If a player initially catches a pass and then, prior to establishing possession,
they do not maintain the catch (‘maintain the catch’ means to continue to
have a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts), that
initial catch is deemed to have ended.
Central zone
The area of the playing field including the goal lines but excluding the end
zones and the perimeter lines.
Defending end zone The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to
prevent the opposition from scoring.
Defensive player
Any player whose team is not in possession of the disc.
End zone
One of the two areas at the end of the playing field where teams can score a
goal by catching the disc there.
Goal line
The line separating the central zone from each end zone. It is not part of the
end zone
Ground
The ground consists of all substantial solid objects, including grass, marker
cones, equipment, water, trees, fences, walls and non-players, but excluding
all players and their worn clothing, airborne particles and precipitation.
Ground contact
Refers to all player contact with the ground directly related to a specific
event or manoeuvre, including landing or recovery after being off-balance
(e.g., jumping, diving, leaning, or falling).
Guarding
A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within three metres
of that offensive player and are primarily focused on and reacting to that
offensive player.
Interception
When a player on the defensive team establishes possession of a throw by a
player on the offensive team.
Legitimate position The stationary or moving position established by a player that is not in
breach of any rules.
Line
A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is
defined as an imaginary line between two field markers with the thickness of
said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining
markers.
Making a play on the
disc
When the disc is in the air and a player is attempting to make contact with
the disc in any way e.g. to catch it or block it. This includes the process of
running towards the place they expect to make contact with the disc.
Marker
The defensive player who may call the stall count on the thrower.
Minor contact
Contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the
movements or position of another player.
Contact with an opponent’s extended arms or hands that are about to, or
already are, contacting the disc, or contact to the throwers hand during the
throwing motion, is not considered to be minor contact.
Non-player
Any person, including a team member, who is not currently a player.
Offensive player
A player whose team is in possession of the disc.
Out-of-bounds (OB) Everything that is not part of the playing field, including the perimeter lines.

Perimeter lines
Lines separating the central zone or end zone from the out-of-bounds area.
They are not part of the playing field.
Pivot
When the thrower moves in any direction while keeping one part of their
body in constant contact with a specific point on the ground called the pivot
point.
A thrower establishes a pivot point by placing, or keeping, a particular part
of their body at a specific point, which they intend to use as their pivot point.
If a thrower has multiple options for a pivot point, the pivot point is not
determined until they pivot.
Pivot Location
The point on the playing field where the thrower is required to establish a
pivot point after a turnover, after the pull, after a time-out, after leaving the
central zone, or where a pivot point has already been established.
Play

The time after the Pull has commenced and prior to the scoring of a goal.
Play may further stop due to a call, in which case play is restarted with a
check.
Player
The people who are actually participating in the current point of play.
Playing Field
The area including the central zone and the end zones, but excluding the
perimeter lines.
Possession of the
disc
A player establishes possession of a pass when:
-
they catch a pass and then they maintain that catch for more than one
noticeable instant, and
-
they maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the
catch, or until they throw the disc
A player can also establish possession when a disc that has already hit the
ground is picked up, or is given to them, after a turnover, pull, or stoppage.
Once a player has established possession, they may change their grip on the
disc and that does not affect their possession, as long as they maintain
contact with the disc.
A disc in the possession of a player, or caught by a player, is considered part
of that player.
The team whose player is in possession or whose players may pick up the
disc is considered the team in possession.
Pre-stall
A warning regarding time limits to resume play, issued by giving warnings at
twenty (20), ten (10), and five (5) seconds (as applicable).
Pull
The throw by the defence to the offence that starts play at the beginning of a
half or after a goal. The pull is not considered a legal pass.
Receivers
All offensive players other than the thrower.
Spirit Stoppage
A stoppage to discuss issues related to Spirit of the Game.
Stoppage of play
Any halting of play due to a foul, violation, discussion, contested call, injury
or time-out, that requires a check to restart play.
Throw
A disc in flight following any throwing motion, including after a fake attempt
and an intentionally dropped disc, that results in loss of contact between the
thrower and the disc.
A pass is the equivalent of a throw.
Thrower
The offensive player in possession of the disc, or the player who has just
thrown the disc prior to when the result of the throw has been determined.
Throwing motion
The throwing motion is the motion that transfers momentum from the
thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots
and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
Turnover
Any event resulting in a change of the team in possession. A turnover is not
considered a violation.
Where the disc
stops
Refers to the location where a player establishes possession, the disc comes
to rest naturally, or where the disc is stopped from rolling or sliding.
