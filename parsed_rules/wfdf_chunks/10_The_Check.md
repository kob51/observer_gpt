## 10. The Check

<!-- section: 10 source: wfdf -->

### 10.1. Whenever play stops during a point for a foul, violation, contested turnover, specified turnover,
<!-- rule: 10.1 source: wfdf -->

contested goal, stoppage, discussion, or at the completion of a time-out, play must restart as quickly as
possible with a check. The check may only be delayed for the discussion of a call.
### 10.2. Player positioning after a call (except in the case of a time-out, and unless specified otherwise):
<!-- rule: 10.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.2.1.** If play stops before a pass is thrown, all players must return to the location they held when the
        <!-- rule: 10.2.1 source: wfdf -->
call was made.
      - **10.2.2.** If play stops after a pass is thrown, then:
        <!-- rule: 10.2.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.2.2.1.** if the disc is returned to the thrower, all players must return to the location they held
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.1 source: wfdf -->
when the thrower released the pass, or the time of the call, whichever is earlier.
        - **10.2.2.2.** if the result of the play stands all players must return to the location they held when either
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.2 source: wfdf -->
a player established possession, or the disc hit the ground.
        - **10.2.2.3.** if a player other than the thrower gains possession as a result of an accepted breach, all
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.3 source: wfdf -->
players must return to the location they held when the breach occurred.
      - **10.2.3.** All players must remain stationary in that location until the disc is checked in.
        <!-- rule: 10.2.3 source: wfdf -->
### 10.3. Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to fix faulty equipment (“equipment”), but active play
<!-- rule: 10.3 source: wfdf -->

may not be stopped for this purpose.
### 10.4. Prior to the check the person checking the disc in, and the nearest opposition player, must verify that
<!-- rule: 10.4 source: wfdf -->

their own team-mates are ready, and positioned as per 10.2.
### 10.5. If there is an unnecessary delay in checking the disc in, the opposition may give a warning (“Delay of
<!-- rule: 10.5 source: wfdf -->

Game”). If the delay continues, the team that gave the warning may check the disc in by calling “Disc In”,
without verification from the opposition, but only if the team checking the disc in are all stationary, and
positioned as per 10.2.
### 10.6. To restart play with a check:
<!-- rule: 10.6 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.6.1.** when the thrower has the disc:
        <!-- rule: 10.6.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.6.1.1.** if there is a defender within reach, the defender must touch the disc.
          <!-- rule: 10.6.1.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.6.1.2.** if there is not a defender within reach, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground and
          <!-- rule: 10.6.1.2 source: wfdf -->
may call “Disc In”.
      - **10.6.2.** when the disc is on the ground, the defender nearest to the disc must call “Disc In”.
        <!-- rule: 10.6.2 source: wfdf -->

### 10.7. A player may call a violation regarding the check if an opponent:
<!-- rule: 10.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.7.1.** attempts a pass without an appropriate check as per 10.6; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.2.** restarts play without verification from their nearest opposition player; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.3.** is moving immediately prior to the check; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.4.** was not in the appropriate position.
        <!-- rule: 10.7.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.5.** After this violation call any pass does not count regardless of whether it is complete or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.5 source: wfdf -->
incomplete, and possession reverts back to the thrower (unless 16.3 applies).
