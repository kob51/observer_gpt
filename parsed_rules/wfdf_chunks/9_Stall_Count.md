## 9. Stall Count

<!-- section: 9 source: wfdf -->

### 9.1. The marker administers a stall count on the thrower by announcing “Stalling” and then counting from
<!-- rule: 9.1 source: wfdf -->

one (1) to ten (10). The interval between the start of each number in the stall count must be at least one
(1) second.
### 9.2. The stall count must be clearly communicated to the thrower.
<!-- rule: 9.2 source: wfdf -->

### 9.3. The marker may only start and continue a stall count when:
<!-- rule: 9.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **9.3.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.1 source: wfdf -->
Play is live, or once a pivot point is established after a turnover;

      - **9.3.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.2 source: wfdf -->
They are within three (3) metres of the thrower’s pivot point, or the pivot location if the
thrower is not at that location; and
      - **9.3.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.3 source: wfdf -->
All defenders are legally positioned (Section 18.1).
### 9.4. If the marker moves beyond the appropriate three (3) metre radius, or a different player becomes the
<!-- rule: 9.4 source: wfdf -->

marker, the stall count must be restarted at “Stalling one (1)”.
### 9.5. After a stoppage in play the stall count is resumed as follows:
<!-- rule: 9.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **9.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.1 source: wfdf -->
After an accepted breach by the defence the stall count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”.
      - **9.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.2 source: wfdf -->
After an accepted breach by the offence the stall count restarts at maximum nine (9).
      - **9.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.3 source: wfdf -->
After a contested stall-out the stall count restarts at “Stalling eight (8)”.
      - **9.5.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.4 source: wfdf -->
After continuation of play in accordance with rule 16.3.2 the stall count restarts at “Stalling one
(1)”.
      - **9.5.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.5 source: wfdf -->
After all other calls, including “pick”, the stall count restarts at maximum six (6). However:
        - **9.5.5.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 9.5.5.1 source: wfdf -->
If there is a call involving the thrower, and a separate receiving breach, and the disc is
returned to the thrower, the stall count is resumed based on the outcome of the call
involving the thrower.
        - **9.5.5.2.** 
          <!-- rule: 9.5.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If there is a violation called related to The Check (Section 10.), the stall count resumes at
the same count that was determined prior to that violation.
### 9.6. To restart a stall count “at maximum n”, where “n” is determined by 9.5.2, 9.5.5, or 20.3.6, means the
<!-- rule: 9.6 source: wfdf -->

following:
      - **9.6.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.6.1 source: wfdf -->
If “x” is the last agreed number fully uttered prior to the call, then the stall count resumes at
“Stalling (x plus one)” or “Stalling n”, whichever of those two numbers is lower.
