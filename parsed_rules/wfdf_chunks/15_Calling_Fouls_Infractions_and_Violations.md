## 15. Calling Fouls, Infractions and Violations

<!-- section: 15 source: wfdf -->

### 15.1. A breach of the rules due to non-minor contact between two or more opposing players is a foul.
<!-- rule: 15.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **15.1.1.** A player intentionally initiating minor contact is still a breach of the rules, but is to be treated as a
        <!-- rule: 15.1.1 source: wfdf -->
violation, and not a foul.
### 15.2. A breach of the rules regarding a Marking or Travel breach is an infraction. Infractions do not stop play.
<!-- rule: 15.2 source: wfdf -->

### 15.3. Every other breach of the rules is a violation.
<!-- rule: 15.3 source: wfdf -->

### 15.4. Only the player fouled may claim a foul, by calling “Foul”.
<!-- rule: 15.4 source: wfdf -->

### 15.5. In general only the thrower may claim an infraction, by calling the specific name of the infraction.
<!-- rule: 15.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **15.5.1.** However any offensive player may call a double team, and any defensive player may call a travel
        <!-- rule: 15.5.1 source: wfdf -->
infraction.
### 15.6. Any opposing player may claim a violation, by calling the specific name of the violation or "Violation",
<!-- rule: 15.6 source: wfdf -->

unless specified otherwise by the particular rule.
### 15.7. When a foul or violation call is made that stops play, players must stop play by visibly or audibly
<!-- rule: 15.7 source: wfdf -->

communicating the stoppage as soon as they are aware of the call and all players should echo calls on the
field. If play has stopped for a discussion without any call having been made, a call is deemed to have been
made when the discussion started.
### 15.8. Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised.
<!-- rule: 15.8 source: wfdf -->

### 15.9. After a player initiates a stoppage incorrectly, including after mishearing a call, not knowing the rules, or
<!-- rule: 15.9 source: wfdf -->

not making the call immediately:
      - **15.9.1.** if the opposition gains or retains possession, any subsequent play stands.
        <!-- rule: 15.9.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **15.9.2.** if the opposition does not gain or retain possession, the disc must be returned to the last non-
        <!-- rule: 15.9.2 source: wfdf -->
disputed thrower, unless 16.3 applies.
      - **15.9.3.** The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by the player who initiated the
        <!-- rule: 15.9.3 source: wfdf -->
stoppage incorrectly.
### 15.10. If the player against whom the foul, infraction or violation has been called disagrees that it occurred, or
<!-- rule: 15.10 source: wfdf -->

does not think it is a correct call, they may call “Contest”.
### 15.11. If a player making any call subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they can retract the
<!-- rule: 15.11 source: wfdf -->

call, by calling "Retracted". Play resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by that player.
### 15.12. If multiple breaches occur on the same play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved in
<!-- rule: 15.12 source: wfdf -->

reverse sequence (latest breach first, earliest breach last).
### 15.13. Players are encouraged to use the WFDF Hand Signals to communicate all calls.
<!-- rule: 15.13 source: wfdf -->
