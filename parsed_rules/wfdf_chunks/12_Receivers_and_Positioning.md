## 12. Receivers and Positioning

<!-- section: 12 source: wfdf -->

### 12.1. A “catch” occurs when a player has a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts. A catch
<!-- rule: 12.1 source: wfdf -->

can enable a player to establish possession of the disc.
      - **12.1.1.** If the player fails to maintain the catch due to subsequent ground contact related to the catch, or
        <!-- rule: 12.1.1 source: wfdf -->
contact related to the catch with a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition player,
possession is deemed to have not occurred.
### 12.2. After establishing possession, that player becomes the thrower.
<!-- rule: 12.2 source: wfdf -->

### 12.3. If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offence retains possession.
<!-- rule: 12.3 source: wfdf -->

### 12.4. A player in an established position is entitled to remain in that position and must not be contacted by an
<!-- rule: 12.4 source: wfdf -->

opposing player.

### 12.5. Every player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by any opposing player, provided
<!-- rule: 12.5 source: wfdf -->

that they do not initiate contact in taking such a position, and are not moving in a reckless or dangerously
aggressive manner.
      - **12.5.1.** However when the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an
        <!-- rule: 12.5.1 source: wfdf -->
opponent from taking an unoccupied path to make a play on the disc.
### 12.6. All players must attempt to avoid initiating contact with other players, and there is no situation where a
<!-- rule: 12.6 source: wfdf -->

player may justify initiating contact. This includes avoiding initiating contact with a stationary opponent, or
an opponent’s expected position based on their established speed and direction.
      - **12.6.1.** “Making a play for the disc” is not a valid excuse for initiating contact with other players.
        <!-- rule: 12.6.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **12.6.2.** Before a player dives, leaps or jumps away from their position, they must be reasonably certain
        <!-- rule: 12.6.2 source: wfdf -->
they will not initiate contact with an opponent.
      - **12.6.3.** If a player is not reasonably certain that they will be able to make a legal play at the disc before an
        <!-- rule: 12.6.3 source: wfdf -->
opponent who is moving in a legal manner, they must adjust their movements to avoid initiating
contact. If that adjustment is made, the result of the play still stands.
### 12.7. The player who initiates contact is deemed to be the player who:
<!-- rule: 12.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **12.7.1.** arrived at the point of contact after the opponent had already established a legitimate position at
        <!-- rule: 12.7.1 source: wfdf -->
that point (either a stationary or moving opponent), or
      - **12.7.2.** adjusted their movements in a way that created unavoidable contact with an opponent moving in
        <!-- rule: 12.7.2 source: wfdf -->
a legal manner, when taking into account all players’ established position, speed and direction.
      - **12.7.3.** If it is unclear which player initiated contact, and one of the players dived, leaped or jumped away
        <!-- rule: 12.7.3 source: wfdf -->
from their position, that player is deemed to have initiated contact.
### 12.8. Some minor contact may occur as two or more players move towards a single point simultaneously.
<!-- rule: 12.8 source: wfdf -->

Minor contact should be minimized but is not considered a foul.
### 12.9. Players may not use their extended arms or legs to obstruct the movement of opposing players.
<!-- rule: 12.9 source: wfdf -->

### 12.10. No player may physically assist the movement of another player, nor use an item of equipment or
<!-- rule: 12.10 source: wfdf -->

object to assist in contacting the disc.
