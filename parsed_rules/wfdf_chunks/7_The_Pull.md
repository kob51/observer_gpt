## 7. The Pull

<!-- section: 7 source: wfdf -->

### 7.1. At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, play commences with a throw by the defence,
<!-- rule: 7.1 source: wfdf -->

called a “pull”.
      - **7.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.1.1 source: wfdf -->
Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay.
### 7.2. The pull may be made only after both teams have signalled their readiness by having the puller and a
<!-- rule: 7.2 source: wfdf -->

player on offence raise a hand above their head.
### 7.3. After signalling readiness all offensive players must stand with one foot on their defending goal line
<!-- rule: 7.3 source: wfdf -->

without changing location relative to one another until the pull is released.
### 7.4. After signalling readiness all defensive players must keep their feet entirely behind the vertical plane of
<!-- rule: 7.4 source: wfdf -->

the goal line until the pull is released.
### 7.5. If a team breaches 7.3 (“false start”) or 7.4 (“offside”) the opposing team may call the relevant violation.
<!-- rule: 7.5 source: wfdf -->

This must be called before the offence touches the disc (7.8 still applies).
      - **7.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.5.1 source: wfdf -->
If the defence chooses to call a false start, the thrower must establish a pivot point as per 7.9,
### 7.10. , 7.11, or 7.12 and then play restarts as soon as possible as if a time-out had been called at
<!-- rule: 7.10 source: wfdf -->

that location.
      - **7.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If the offence chooses to call offside, they must let the disc hit the ground untouched and then
resume play as if a brick has been called (no check is required).
### 7.6. As soon as the pull is released, all players may move in any direction.
<!-- rule: 7.6 source: wfdf -->

### 7.7. No player on the defensive team may touch the disc after a pull until a member of the offensive team
<!-- rule: 7.7 source: wfdf -->

contacts the disc or the disc hits the ground.
### 7.8. If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the disc before it hits the ground, and the
<!-- rule: 7.8 source: wfdf -->

offensive team fails to subsequently establish possession, that is a turnover (a “dropped pull”).

### 7.9. If an offensive player catches the pull and subsequently establishes possession, they must establish a pivot
<!-- rule: 7.9 source: wfdf -->

point at the location on the playing field nearest to where possession is established, even if that pivot
point is in their defending end zone.
### 7.10. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes out-of-bounds, the thrower must establish
<!-- rule: 7.10 source: wfdf -->

a pivot point where the disc stops, even if that pivot point is in their defending end zone.
### 7.11. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds without contacting an
<!-- rule: 7.11 source: wfdf -->

offensive player, the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line,
or the nearest location in the central zone if that pivot point would be in their defending end zone.
      - **7.11.1.** If the disc does contact an offensive player before it becomes out-of-bounds the thrower must
        <!-- rule: 7.11.1 source: wfdf -->
establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line, even if that pivot point is in
their defending end zone.
### 7.12. If the disc contacts the out-of-bounds area without first touching the playing field or an offensive player,
<!-- rule: 7.12 source: wfdf -->

the thrower may establish a pivot point either at the brick mark closest to their defending end zone, or
at the location on the central zone closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8). The
binding brick option must be signalled before the disc is picked up. It must be signalled by any offensive
player fully extending one arm overhead, and they should call “brick”.
