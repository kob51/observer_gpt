<!-- section: 6 source: wfdf -->

### 6.1. Representatives of the two teams fairly determine which team first chooses either:
<!-- rule: 6.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **6.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 6.1.1 source: wfdf -->
whether to receive or throw the initial pull; or
      - **6.1.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 6.1.2 source: wfdf -->
which end zone they will initially defend.
### 6.2. The other team is given the remaining choice.
<!-- rule: 6.2 source: wfdf -->

### 6.3. At the start of the second half, these initial selections are switched.
<!-- rule: 6.3 source: wfdf -->

### 6.4. For Mixed games, teams should discuss any strategies to make personnel match-ups easier to identify.
