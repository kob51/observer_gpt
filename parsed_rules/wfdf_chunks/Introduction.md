## Introduction

Ultimate is a seven-a-side team sport played with a flying disc. It is played on a rectangular field, about half the
width of a football field, with an end zone at each end. The objective of each team is to score a goal by having a
player catch a pass in the end zone that they are attacking. A thrower may not run with the disc, but may pass the
disc in any direction to any team-mate. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, and the other team shall
establish possession and attempt to score in the opposite end zone. Games are typically played to 15 goals or
around 100 minutes. Ultimate is self-officiated and non-contact. The Spirit of the Game guides how players officiate
the game and conduct themselves on the field.

Many of these rules are general in nature and cover most situations, however some rules cover specific situations
and override the general case.

Variations to the basic structure and rules may be used to accommodate special competitions, number of players,
age of players or available space. Refer to the relevant Appendix for additional rules that apply at specific types of
World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) Events.
