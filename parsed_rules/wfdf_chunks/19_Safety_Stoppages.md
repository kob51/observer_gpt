## 19. Safety Stoppages

<!-- section: 19 source: wfdf -->

### 19.1. Injury Stoppage
<!-- rule: 19.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **19.1.1.** An injury stoppage, “Injury”, may be called by the injured player, or by any player on the injured
        <!-- rule: 19.1.1 source: wfdf -->
player’s team.
      - **19.1.2.** If the injury was not caused by an opponent, the player must choose either to be substituted, or
        <!-- rule: 19.1.2 source: wfdf -->
to charge their own team with a time-out.
      - **19.1.3.** If the injury was caused by an opponent, the player may choose to stay or to be substituted.
        <!-- rule: 19.1.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **19.1.4.** If the injured player had established possession of the disc, and the player has dropped the disc
        <!-- rule: 19.1.4 source: wfdf -->
due to the injury, that player retains possession of the disc.
      - **19.1.5.** The injury stoppage is considered to have been called at the time of the injury, unless the injured
        <!-- rule: 19.1.5 source: wfdf -->
player chooses to continue play before the stoppage is called.
      - **19.1.6.** If the disc was in the air when the injury stoppage was called, play continues until either a player
        <!-- rule: 19.1.6 source: wfdf -->
establishes possession, or the disc hits the ground. If the injury is not the result of a foul by an
opponent, the completion or turnover stands, and play restarts there after the stoppage.
### 19.2. Technical Stoppage
<!-- rule: 19.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **19.2.1.** Any player who recognises a condition that endangers players, including if a player has an open or
        <!-- rule: 19.2.1 source: wfdf -->
bleeding wound, should call a technical stoppage by calling “technical” or “stop”. Play must stop
immediately.
        - **19.2.1.1.** A team-mate, coach, or designated official, should actively alert players to any condition
          <!-- rule: 19.2.1.1 source: wfdf -->
that endangers players.
        - **19.2.1.2.** A player who has an issue regarding an open or bleeding wound has seventy (70) seconds
          <!-- rule: 19.2.1.2 source: wfdf -->
to effectively address the issue. If they need additional time to address the issue, they must
choose either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a time-out.
      - **19.2.2.** The thrower may call a technical stoppage during play to replace a severely damaged disc.
        <!-- rule: 19.2.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **19.2.3.** After a technical stoppage called while the disc is in the air, or if play has continued unknowingly:
        <!-- rule: 19.2.3 source: wfdf -->
        - **19.2.3.1.** If the call or issue did not affect play, the completion or turnover stands, and play restarts
          <!-- rule: 19.2.3.1 source: wfdf -->
there;
        - **19.2.3.2.** If the call or issue did affect the play, the disc goes back to the thrower.
          <!-- rule: 19.2.3.2 source: wfdf -->
### 19.3. If a player is substituted after an injury, or due to illegal or faulty equipment, the opposing team may also
<!-- rule: 19.3 source: wfdf -->

choose to substitute one player.
      - **19.3.1.** Substitute players take on the full state (location, possession, stall count etc) of the player they
        <!-- rule: 19.3.1 source: wfdf -->
are substituting and may make a call on their behalf.
