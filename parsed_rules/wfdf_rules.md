# WFDF Rules of Ultimate 2025-2028

## Introduction

Ultimate is a seven-a-side team sport played with a flying disc. It is played on a rectangular field, about half the
width of a football field, with an end zone at each end. The objective of each team is to score a goal by having a
player catch a pass in the end zone that they are attacking. A thrower may not run with the disc, but may pass the
disc in any direction to any team-mate. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, and the other team shall
establish possession and attempt to score in the opposite end zone. Games are typically played to 15 goals or
around 100 minutes. Ultimate is self-officiated and non-contact. The Spirit of the Game guides how players officiate
the game and conduct themselves on the field.

Many of these rules are general in nature and cover most situations, however some rules cover specific situations
and override the general case.

Variations to the basic structure and rules may be used to accommodate special competitions, number of players,
age of players or available space. Refer to the relevant Appendix for additional rules that apply at specific types of
World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) Events.

## 1. Spirit of the Game

<!-- section: 1 source: wfdf -->

### 1.1. Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated sport. All players are responsible for administering and adhering
<!-- rule: 1.1 source: wfdf -->

to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every
player.
### 1.2. It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for
<!-- rule: 1.2 source: wfdf -->

inadvertent breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would
most likely have occurred had there been no breach.
      - **1.2.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.2.1 source: wfdf -->
If there is a deliberate or egregious breach of the rules or Spirit of the Game, the captains should
discuss this and determine an appropriate outcome, even if that outcome is not in accordance
with a specific rule.
### 1.3. Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration between teams.
<!-- rule: 1.3 source: wfdf -->

Players must:
      - **1.3.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.1 source: wfdf -->
know and abide by both the rules and the spirit of the rules;
      - **1.3.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.2 source: wfdf -->
be fair-minded and objective;
      - **1.3.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.3 source: wfdf -->
be truthful;
      - **1.3.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.4 source: wfdf -->
explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;
      - **1.3.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.5 source: wfdf -->
allow opponents an opportunity to speak;
      - **1.3.6.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.6 source: wfdf -->
listen to and consider opponent’s viewpoint;
      - **1.3.7.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.7 source: wfdf -->
use respectful words and body language with consideration of potential cultural differences;
      - **1.3.8.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.8 source: wfdf -->
resolve disputes efficiently;
      - **1.3.9.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.3.9 source: wfdf -->
make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game; and
      - **1.3.10.** only make a call where a breach is significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the
        <!-- rule: 1.3.10 source: wfdf -->
action, or where a player’s safety is at risk.
### 1.4. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between players,
<!-- rule: 1.4 source: wfdf -->

adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, player safety or the basic joy of play.
### 1.5. The following actions are some examples of good Spirit:
<!-- rule: 1.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **1.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.5.1 source: wfdf -->
retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was correct;
      - **1.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.5.2 source: wfdf -->
checking in with an opponent on the sideline after a contentious interaction;
      - **1.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.5.3 source: wfdf -->
complimenting an opponent for good play or Spirit;
      - **1.5.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.5.4 source: wfdf -->
introducing yourself to your opponent; and
      - **1.5.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.5.5 source: wfdf -->
reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.
### 1.6. The following actions are clear violations of the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided:
<!-- rule: 1.6 source: wfdf -->

      - **1.6.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.1 source: wfdf -->
dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;
      - **1.6.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.2 source: wfdf -->
intentional fouling or other intentional rule breaches;
      - **1.6.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.3 source: wfdf -->
taunting or intimidating opposing players;
      - **1.6.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.4 source: wfdf -->
celebrating disrespectfully after scoring;
      - **1.6.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.5 source: wfdf -->
making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s call;
      - **1.6.6.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.6 source: wfdf -->
calling for a pass from an opposition player; and
      - **1.6.7.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.6.7 source: wfdf -->
other win-at-all-costs behaviour.
### 1.7. Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:
<!-- rule: 1.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **1.7.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.7.1 source: wfdf -->
take responsibility for teaching their team the rules and good Spirit;
      - **1.7.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.7.2 source: wfdf -->
discipline team-mates who display poor Spirit;
      - **1.7.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.7.3 source: wfdf -->
provide constructive feedback to other teams about what they are doing well and/or how to
improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game; and
      - **1.7.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 1.7.4 source: wfdf -->
call a Spirit Stoppage to address Spirit issues, as appropriate.
### 1.8. In the case where a novice player is involved in a breach and does not know the rules, experienced
<!-- rule: 1.8 source: wfdf -->

players should assist to explain the breach.
### 1.9. An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides on-field arbitration, may supervise games
<!-- rule: 1.9 source: wfdf -->

involving beginners or younger players.
### 1.10. Calls should be discussed by the players directly involved in the play, and by players who had the best
<!-- rule: 1.10 source: wfdf -->

perspective on the play.
      - **1.10.1.** If a player who was not directly involved believes that a team-mate has made an incorrect call, or
        <!-- rule: 1.10.1 source: wfdf -->
caused a foul or violation, they should inform their team-mate.

      - **1.10.2.** Non-players, apart from the captains, should refrain from getting involved. However players may
        <!-- rule: 1.10.2 source: wfdf -->
seek other peoples’ perspectives to clarify the rules, and to assist players to make the
appropriate call.
### 1.11. Players and captains are solely responsible for making and resolving all calls.
<!-- rule: 1.11 source: wfdf -->

### 1.12. If after discussion players cannot agree, or it is not clear and obvious:
<!-- rule: 1.12 source: wfdf -->

      - **1.12.1.** what occurred in a play, or
        <!-- rule: 1.12.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **1.12.2.** what would most likely have occurred in a play,
        <!-- rule: 1.12.2 source: wfdf -->
the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
## 2. Playing Field

<!-- section: 2 source: wfdf -->

### 2.1. The playing field is a rectangular area with dimensions and zones as shown on Figure 1 and should be
<!-- rule: 2.1 source: wfdf -->

essentially flat, free of obstructions and afford reasonable player safety.
### 2.2. The perimeter lines surround the playing field and consist of two (2) sidelines along the length and two
<!-- rule: 2.2 source: wfdf -->

(2) endlines along the width.
### 2.3. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field.
<!-- rule: 2.3 source: wfdf -->

### 2.4. The goal lines are the lines that separate the central zone from the end zones and are part of the central
<!-- rule: 2.4 source: wfdf -->

zone.
### 2.5. The brick marks are the intersection of two (2) crossed one (1) metre lines in the central zone, located a
<!-- rule: 2.5 source: wfdf -->

distance equal to the length of the end zone away from each goal line, midway between the sidelines.
### 2.6. Eight brightly-coloured, flexible objects (such as plastic cones) mark the corners of the central zone and
<!-- rule: 2.6 source: wfdf -->

the end zones.
### 2.7. The immediate surroundings of the playing field shall be kept clear of movable objects. If play is
<!-- rule: 2.7 source: wfdf -->

obstructed by non-players or objects within three (3) metres of the perimeter line, any obstructed player
or thrower in possession may call “Violation”.

Figure 1
## 3. Equipment

<!-- section: 3 source: wfdf -->

### 3.1. Any flying disc acceptable to both captains may be used.
<!-- rule: 3.1 source: wfdf -->

### 3.2. WFDF may maintain a list of approved discs recommended for use.
<!-- rule: 3.2 source: wfdf -->

### 3.3. Each player must wear a uniform that distinguishes their team.
<!-- rule: 3.3 source: wfdf -->

### 3.4. No player may wear items of clothing or equipment that reasonably could harm the wearer or other
<!-- rule: 3.4 source: wfdf -->

players, or impede an opponent's ability to play.
## 4. Point, Goal and Game

<!-- section: 4 source: wfdf -->

### 4.1. A game consists of a number of points. Each point ends with the scoring of a goal.
<!-- rule: 4.1 source: wfdf -->

### 4.2. A game is finished and won by the first team to score fifteen (15) goals.
<!-- rule: 4.2 source: wfdf -->

### 4.3. A game is separated into two (2) periods of play, called halves.  Half time occurs when a team first scores
<!-- rule: 4.3 source: wfdf -->

eight (8) goals.
### 4.4. The first point of each half starts when the half starts.
<!-- rule: 4.4 source: wfdf -->

### 4.5. After a goal is scored, and the game has not been won or half time has not been reached:
<!-- rule: 4.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **4.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 4.5.1 source: wfdf -->
the next point starts immediately;
      - **4.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 4.5.2 source: wfdf -->
the teams switch the end zone that they are defending; and
      - **4.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 4.5.3 source: wfdf -->
the team that scored becomes defence and pulls next.
## 5. Teams

<!-- section: 5 source: wfdf -->

### 5.1. Each team will put a maximum of seven (7) players and a minimum of five (5) players on the field during
<!-- rule: 5.1 source: wfdf -->

each point.
### 5.2. Each team must designate a captain and a spirit captain to represent the team.
<!-- rule: 5.2 source: wfdf -->

### 5.3. A team may make unlimited substitutions after a goal is scored and before their team signals readiness
<!-- rule: 5.3 source: wfdf -->

for the pull.
### 5.4. For Mixed games, a form of an alternating 4:3 personnel ratio should be used.
<!-- rule: 5.4 source: wfdf -->

## 6. Starting a Game

<!-- section: 6 source: wfdf -->

### 6.1. Representatives of the two teams fairly determine which team first chooses either:
<!-- rule: 6.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **6.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 6.1.1 source: wfdf -->
whether to receive or throw the initial pull; or
      - **6.1.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 6.1.2 source: wfdf -->
which end zone they will initially defend.
### 6.2. The other team is given the remaining choice.
<!-- rule: 6.2 source: wfdf -->

### 6.3. At the start of the second half, these initial selections are switched.
<!-- rule: 6.3 source: wfdf -->

### 6.4. For Mixed games, teams should discuss any strategies to make personnel match-ups easier to identify.
<!-- rule: 6.4 source: wfdf -->

## 7. The Pull

<!-- section: 7 source: wfdf -->

### 7.1. At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, play commences with a throw by the defence,
<!-- rule: 7.1 source: wfdf -->

called a “pull”.
      - **7.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.1.1 source: wfdf -->
Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay.
### 7.2. The pull may be made only after both teams have signalled their readiness by having the puller and a
<!-- rule: 7.2 source: wfdf -->

player on offence raise a hand above their head.
### 7.3. After signalling readiness all offensive players must stand with one foot on their defending goal line
<!-- rule: 7.3 source: wfdf -->

without changing location relative to one another until the pull is released.
### 7.4. After signalling readiness all defensive players must keep their feet entirely behind the vertical plane of
<!-- rule: 7.4 source: wfdf -->

the goal line until the pull is released.
### 7.5. If a team breaches 7.3 (“false start”) or 7.4 (“offside”) the opposing team may call the relevant violation.
<!-- rule: 7.5 source: wfdf -->

This must be called before the offence touches the disc (7.8 still applies).
      - **7.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.5.1 source: wfdf -->
If the defence chooses to call a false start, the thrower must establish a pivot point as per 7.9,
### 7.10. , 7.11, or 7.12 and then play restarts as soon as possible as if a time-out had been called at
<!-- rule: 7.10 source: wfdf -->

that location.
      - **7.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 7.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If the offence chooses to call offside, they must let the disc hit the ground untouched and then
resume play as if a brick has been called (no check is required).
### 7.6. As soon as the pull is released, all players may move in any direction.
<!-- rule: 7.6 source: wfdf -->

### 7.7. No player on the defensive team may touch the disc after a pull until a member of the offensive team
<!-- rule: 7.7 source: wfdf -->

contacts the disc or the disc hits the ground.
### 7.8. If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the disc before it hits the ground, and the
<!-- rule: 7.8 source: wfdf -->

offensive team fails to subsequently establish possession, that is a turnover (a “dropped pull”).

### 7.9. If an offensive player catches the pull and subsequently establishes possession, they must establish a pivot
<!-- rule: 7.9 source: wfdf -->

point at the location on the playing field nearest to where possession is established, even if that pivot
point is in their defending end zone.
### 7.10. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes out-of-bounds, the thrower must establish
<!-- rule: 7.10 source: wfdf -->

a pivot point where the disc stops, even if that pivot point is in their defending end zone.
### 7.11. If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds without contacting an
<!-- rule: 7.11 source: wfdf -->

offensive player, the thrower must establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line,
or the nearest location in the central zone if that pivot point would be in their defending end zone.
      - **7.11.1.** If the disc does contact an offensive player before it becomes out-of-bounds the thrower must
        <!-- rule: 7.11.1 source: wfdf -->
establish a pivot point where the disc first crossed the perimeter line, even if that pivot point is in
their defending end zone.
### 7.12. If the disc contacts the out-of-bounds area without first touching the playing field or an offensive player,
<!-- rule: 7.12 source: wfdf -->

the thrower may establish a pivot point either at the brick mark closest to their defending end zone, or
at the location on the central zone closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8). The
binding brick option must be signalled before the disc is picked up. It must be signalled by any offensive
player fully extending one arm overhead, and they should call “brick”.
## 8. State of Play

<!-- section: 8 source: wfdf -->

### 8.1. Play is “dead”, and no turnover is possible:
<!-- rule: 8.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **8.1.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.1 source: wfdf -->
After the start of a point, until the pull is released;
      - **8.1.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.2 source: wfdf -->
When the disc must be carried to the pivot location after the pull or a turnover, until a pivot
point is established;
      - **8.1.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.3 source: wfdf -->
After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked in; or
      - **8.1.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.4 source: wfdf -->
After a disc hits the ground, until possession is established by the appropriate team.
      - **8.1.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.1.5 source: wfdf -->
Players are allowed to move during dead play (unless specified otherwise).
### 8.2. Play that is not dead is “live”.
<!-- rule: 8.2 source: wfdf -->

### 8.3. The thrower may not transfer possession of the disc during dead play to another player.
<!-- rule: 8.3 source: wfdf -->

### 8.4. Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the ground.
<!-- rule: 8.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **8.4.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.4.1 source: wfdf -->
If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly alters the disc’s position, the opposition
may request that the pivot point be established at the location where the disc was contacted.
### 8.5. After a turnover, and after the pull, an offensive player must move at walking pace or faster to directly
<!-- rule: 8.5 source: wfdf -->

retrieve the disc and establish a pivot point.
      - **8.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.1 source: wfdf -->
In addition to 8.5, after a turnover the thrower must establish a pivot point within the following
time limits, if the disc did not become out-of-bounds, and the disc’s location is:
        - **8.5.1.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.1.1 source: wfdf -->
in the central zone – within ten (10) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
        - **8.5.1.2.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.1.2 source: wfdf -->
in an end zone – within twenty (20) seconds of the disc coming to rest.
      - **8.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If the offence breaches 8.5, or 8.5.1, the defence may give a warning (“Delay of Game” or using a
pre-stall for breaches of 8.5.1) or may call a “Violation”.
        - **8.5.2.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 8.5.2.1 source: wfdf -->
If, after a warning, the offence continues to breach 8.5, or 8.5.1, then 9.3.1 does not apply
and the marker may commence the stall count.
      - **8.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.3 source: wfdf -->
The defence must not move in a manner that obstructs the offence from taking possession of the
disc or establishing a pivot point.
      - **8.5.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 8.5.4 source: wfdf -->
If players cannot agree on the correct pivot location, the relevant midpoint between the two
proposed pivot locations must be used.
## 9. Stall Count

<!-- section: 9 source: wfdf -->

### 9.1. The marker administers a stall count on the thrower by announcing “Stalling” and then counting from
<!-- rule: 9.1 source: wfdf -->

one (1) to ten (10). The interval between the start of each number in the stall count must be at least one
(1) second.
### 9.2. The stall count must be clearly communicated to the thrower.
<!-- rule: 9.2 source: wfdf -->

### 9.3. The marker may only start and continue a stall count when:
<!-- rule: 9.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **9.3.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.1 source: wfdf -->
Play is live, or once a pivot point is established after a turnover;

      - **9.3.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.2 source: wfdf -->
They are within three (3) metres of the thrower’s pivot point, or the pivot location if the
thrower is not at that location; and
      - **9.3.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.3.3 source: wfdf -->
All defenders are legally positioned (Section 18.1).
### 9.4. If the marker moves beyond the appropriate three (3) metre radius, or a different player becomes the
<!-- rule: 9.4 source: wfdf -->

marker, the stall count must be restarted at “Stalling one (1)”.
### 9.5. After a stoppage in play the stall count is resumed as follows:
<!-- rule: 9.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **9.5.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.1 source: wfdf -->
After an accepted breach by the defence the stall count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”.
      - **9.5.2.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.2 source: wfdf -->
After an accepted breach by the offence the stall count restarts at maximum nine (9).
      - **9.5.3.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.3 source: wfdf -->
After a contested stall-out the stall count restarts at “Stalling eight (8)”.
      - **9.5.4.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.4 source: wfdf -->
After continuation of play in accordance with rule 16.3.2 the stall count restarts at “Stalling one
(1)”.
      - **9.5.5.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.5.5 source: wfdf -->
After all other calls, including “pick”, the stall count restarts at maximum six (6). However:
        - **9.5.5.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 9.5.5.1 source: wfdf -->
If there is a call involving the thrower, and a separate receiving breach, and the disc is
returned to the thrower, the stall count is resumed based on the outcome of the call
involving the thrower.
        - **9.5.5.2.** 
          <!-- rule: 9.5.5.2 source: wfdf -->
If there is a violation called related to The Check (Section 10.), the stall count resumes at
the same count that was determined prior to that violation.
### 9.6. To restart a stall count “at maximum n”, where “n” is determined by 9.5.2, 9.5.5, or 20.3.6, means the
<!-- rule: 9.6 source: wfdf -->

following:
      - **9.6.1.** 
        <!-- rule: 9.6.1 source: wfdf -->
If “x” is the last agreed number fully uttered prior to the call, then the stall count resumes at
“Stalling (x plus one)” or “Stalling n”, whichever of those two numbers is lower.
## 10. The Check

<!-- section: 10 source: wfdf -->

### 10.1. Whenever play stops during a point for a foul, violation, contested turnover, specified turnover,
<!-- rule: 10.1 source: wfdf -->

contested goal, stoppage, discussion, or at the completion of a time-out, play must restart as quickly as
possible with a check. The check may only be delayed for the discussion of a call.
### 10.2. Player positioning after a call (except in the case of a time-out, and unless specified otherwise):
<!-- rule: 10.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.2.1.** If play stops before a pass is thrown, all players must return to the location they held when the
        <!-- rule: 10.2.1 source: wfdf -->
call was made.
      - **10.2.2.** If play stops after a pass is thrown, then:
        <!-- rule: 10.2.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.2.2.1.** if the disc is returned to the thrower, all players must return to the location they held
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.1 source: wfdf -->
when the thrower released the pass, or the time of the call, whichever is earlier.
        - **10.2.2.2.** if the result of the play stands all players must return to the location they held when either
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.2 source: wfdf -->
a player established possession, or the disc hit the ground.
        - **10.2.2.3.** if a player other than the thrower gains possession as a result of an accepted breach, all
          <!-- rule: 10.2.2.3 source: wfdf -->
players must return to the location they held when the breach occurred.
      - **10.2.3.** All players must remain stationary in that location until the disc is checked in.
        <!-- rule: 10.2.3 source: wfdf -->
### 10.3. Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to fix faulty equipment (“equipment”), but active play
<!-- rule: 10.3 source: wfdf -->

may not be stopped for this purpose.
### 10.4. Prior to the check the person checking the disc in, and the nearest opposition player, must verify that
<!-- rule: 10.4 source: wfdf -->

their own team-mates are ready, and positioned as per 10.2.
### 10.5. If there is an unnecessary delay in checking the disc in, the opposition may give a warning (“Delay of
<!-- rule: 10.5 source: wfdf -->

Game”). If the delay continues, the team that gave the warning may check the disc in by calling “Disc In”,
without verification from the opposition, but only if the team checking the disc in are all stationary, and
positioned as per 10.2.
### 10.6. To restart play with a check:
<!-- rule: 10.6 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.6.1.** when the thrower has the disc:
        <!-- rule: 10.6.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.6.1.1.** if there is a defender within reach, the defender must touch the disc.
          <!-- rule: 10.6.1.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **10.6.1.2.** if there is not a defender within reach, the thrower must touch the disc to the ground and
          <!-- rule: 10.6.1.2 source: wfdf -->
may call “Disc In”.
      - **10.6.2.** when the disc is on the ground, the defender nearest to the disc must call “Disc In”.
        <!-- rule: 10.6.2 source: wfdf -->

### 10.7. A player may call a violation regarding the check if an opponent:
<!-- rule: 10.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **10.7.1.** attempts a pass without an appropriate check as per 10.6; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.2.** restarts play without verification from their nearest opposition player; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.3.** is moving immediately prior to the check; or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.4.** was not in the appropriate position.
        <!-- rule: 10.7.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **10.7.5.** After this violation call any pass does not count regardless of whether it is complete or
        <!-- rule: 10.7.5 source: wfdf -->
incomplete, and possession reverts back to the thrower (unless 16.3 applies).
## 11. Out-of-Bounds

<!-- section: 11 source: wfdf -->

### 11.1. The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.1 source: wfdf -->

bounds. All non-players are part of the out-of-bounds area.
### 11.2. The out-of-bounds area consists of the ground which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it,
<!-- rule: 11.2 source: wfdf -->

except for defensive players, who are always considered “in-bounds”.
### 11.3. An offensive player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds.
<!-- rule: 11.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **11.3.1.** An airborne player retains their in-bounds/out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the
        <!-- rule: 11.3.1 source: wfdf -->
playing field or the out-of-bounds area.
      - **11.3.2.** A player who has caught the disc, who contacts the playing field and then contacts an out-of-
        <!-- rule: 11.3.2 source: wfdf -->
bounds area, is still considered in-bounds, as long as they maintain the catch until they establish
possession.
        - **11.3.2.1.** If they leave the playing field, they must establish a pivot point at the location on the playing
          <!-- rule: 11.3.2.1 source: wfdf -->
field where they crossed the perimeter line (unless 14.3 is in effect).
      - **11.3.3.** A thrower who contacts an out-of-bounds area is considered in-bounds until they make a pass.
        <!-- rule: 11.3.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.3.4.** Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of-bounds from one to
        <!-- rule: 11.3.4 source: wfdf -->
another.
### 11.4. The following are out-of-bounds turnovers, and no catch is deemed to have occurred:
<!-- rule: 11.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **11.4.1.** any part of an offensive receiver is out-of-bounds when they contact the disc; or
        <!-- rule: 11.4.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.4.2.** after catching the disc while airborne, an offensive receiver’s first contact is out-of-bounds while
        <!-- rule: 11.4.2 source: wfdf -->
still in contact with the disc.
### 11.5. A disc is in-bounds once play is live, or when play starts or restarts.
<!-- rule: 11.5 source: wfdf -->

### 11.6. A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area or contacts an out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.6 source: wfdf -->

bounds offensive player. A disc that has been caught by an offensive player has the same in/out-of-bounds
status as that player. If the disc is simultaneously caught by more than one offensive player, one of them
being out-of-bounds, the disc is out-of-bounds.
### 11.7. The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go out-of-
<!-- rule: 11.7 source: wfdf -->

bounds to make a play on the disc.
### 11.8. The place where a disc went out-of-bounds is the location where, prior to contacting an out-of-bounds
<!-- rule: 11.8 source: wfdf -->

area or player, the disc was most recently:
      - **11.8.1.** partly or wholly over the playing field; or
        <!-- rule: 11.8.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **11.8.2.** contacted by an in-bounds player.
        <!-- rule: 11.8.2 source: wfdf -->
### 11.9. If the disc is out-of-bounds and more than three (3) metres from the pivot location, non-players may
<!-- rule: 11.9 source: wfdf -->

retrieve the disc. The thrower must carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the playing field.
## 12. Receivers and Positioning

<!-- section: 12 source: wfdf -->

### 12.1. A “catch” occurs when a player has a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts. A catch
<!-- rule: 12.1 source: wfdf -->

can enable a player to establish possession of the disc.
      - **12.1.1.** If the player fails to maintain the catch due to subsequent ground contact related to the catch, or
        <!-- rule: 12.1.1 source: wfdf -->
contact related to the catch with a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition player,
possession is deemed to have not occurred.
### 12.2. After establishing possession, that player becomes the thrower.
<!-- rule: 12.2 source: wfdf -->

### 12.3. If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offence retains possession.
<!-- rule: 12.3 source: wfdf -->

### 12.4. A player in an established position is entitled to remain in that position and must not be contacted by an
<!-- rule: 12.4 source: wfdf -->

opposing player.

### 12.5. Every player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by any opposing player, provided
<!-- rule: 12.5 source: wfdf -->

that they do not initiate contact in taking such a position, and are not moving in a reckless or dangerously
aggressive manner.
      - **12.5.1.** However when the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an
        <!-- rule: 12.5.1 source: wfdf -->
opponent from taking an unoccupied path to make a play on the disc.
### 12.6. All players must attempt to avoid initiating contact with other players, and there is no situation where a
<!-- rule: 12.6 source: wfdf -->

player may justify initiating contact. This includes avoiding initiating contact with a stationary opponent, or
an opponent’s expected position based on their established speed and direction.
      - **12.6.1.** “Making a play for the disc” is not a valid excuse for initiating contact with other players.
        <!-- rule: 12.6.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **12.6.2.** Before a player dives, leaps or jumps away from their position, they must be reasonably certain
        <!-- rule: 12.6.2 source: wfdf -->
they will not initiate contact with an opponent.
      - **12.6.3.** If a player is not reasonably certain that they will be able to make a legal play at the disc before an
        <!-- rule: 12.6.3 source: wfdf -->
opponent who is moving in a legal manner, they must adjust their movements to avoid initiating
contact. If that adjustment is made, the result of the play still stands.
### 12.7. The player who initiates contact is deemed to be the player who:
<!-- rule: 12.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **12.7.1.** arrived at the point of contact after the opponent had already established a legitimate position at
        <!-- rule: 12.7.1 source: wfdf -->
that point (either a stationary or moving opponent), or
      - **12.7.2.** adjusted their movements in a way that created unavoidable contact with an opponent moving in
        <!-- rule: 12.7.2 source: wfdf -->
a legal manner, when taking into account all players’ established position, speed and direction.
      - **12.7.3.** If it is unclear which player initiated contact, and one of the players dived, leaped or jumped away
        <!-- rule: 12.7.3 source: wfdf -->
from their position, that player is deemed to have initiated contact.
### 12.8. Some minor contact may occur as two or more players move towards a single point simultaneously.
<!-- rule: 12.8 source: wfdf -->

Minor contact should be minimized but is not considered a foul.
### 12.9. Players may not use their extended arms or legs to obstruct the movement of opposing players.
<!-- rule: 12.9 source: wfdf -->

### 12.10. No player may physically assist the movement of another player, nor use an item of equipment or
<!-- rule: 12.10 source: wfdf -->

object to assist in contacting the disc.
## 13. Turnovers

<!-- section: 13 source: wfdf -->

### 13.1. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to the other occurs when:
<!-- rule: 13.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **13.1.1.** the disc contacts the ground while it is not in the possession of an offensive player (a “down”);
        <!-- rule: 13.1.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **13.1.1.1.** however it is not “down” if a receiver catches a pass before the disc contacts the ground,
          <!-- rule: 13.1.1.1 source: wfdf -->
and maintains the catch while the disc is in contact with the ground.
      - **13.1.2.** a defensive player establishes possession of a pass (an “interception”);
        <!-- rule: 13.1.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.1.3.** the disc becomes out-of-bounds (an “out-of-bounds” or “out”); or
        <!-- rule: 13.1.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.1.4.** during the pull, the offence touches the disc before it hits the ground, and subsequently fails to
        <!-- rule: 13.1.4 source: wfdf -->
establish possession of the disc (a “dropped pull”).
### 13.2. A turnover that transfers possession of the disc from one team to the other, and results in a stoppage of
<!-- rule: 13.2 source: wfdf -->

play, occurs when:
      - **13.2.1.** there is an accepted offensive receiving foul;
        <!-- rule: 13.2.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.2.2.** the thrower has not released the pass before the marker first starts to say the word “ten” in the
        <!-- rule: 13.2.2 source: wfdf -->
stall count (a “stall-out”);
      - **13.2.3.** the disc is intentionally transferred from one offensive player to another without ever being
        <!-- rule: 13.2.3 source: wfdf -->
completely untouched by both players (a “handover”);
      - **13.2.4.** the thrower intentionally deflects a pass to themselves off another player (a “deflection”);
        <!-- rule: 13.2.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.2.5.** in attempting a pass, the thrower catches the disc after release prior to the disc being contacted
        <!-- rule: 13.2.5 source: wfdf -->
by another player (a “self-catch”);
      - **13.2.6.** an offensive player intentionally assists a team-mate’s movement to catch a pass; or
        <!-- rule: 13.2.6 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.2.7.** an offensive player uses an item of equipment or object to assist in catching a pass.
        <!-- rule: 13.2.7 source: wfdf -->
### 13.3. If a player determines a turnover has occurred they must make the appropriate call immediately. If the
<!-- rule: 13.3 source: wfdf -->

opposition disagrees they may call "contest" and play must stop. If, after discussion, players cannot agree
or it is unclear what occurred in the play, the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.

### 13.4. After a “stall-out” call:
<!-- rule: 13.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **13.4.1.** If the thrower still has possession of the disc, but they believe a fast count occurred in such a
        <!-- rule: 13.4.1 source: wfdf -->
manner that they did not have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out, the
play is treated as either an accepted defensive breach (9.5.1) or a contested stall-out (9.5.3).
      - **13.4.2.** If the thrower made a completed pass, the thrower can contest if they believe it was not a “stall-
        <!-- rule: 13.4.2 source: wfdf -->
out”, or there was a fast count immediately prior to the “stall-out”.
      - **13.4.3.** If the thrower contests a stall-out but also attempts a pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the
        <!-- rule: 13.4.3 source: wfdf -->
turnover stands and play restarts with a check.
### 13.5. Any offensive player may establish possession of the disc after a turnover, except:
<!-- rule: 13.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **13.5.1.** after an “interception” turnover, in which case the player who made the interception must
        <!-- rule: 13.5.1 source: wfdf -->
maintain possession; and
      - **13.5.2.** after an accepted receiving foul caused by the offence, in which case the fouled player must
        <!-- rule: 13.5.2 source: wfdf -->
establish possession.
### 13.6. If the player in possession after a turnover, or after a pull that has already hit the ground, intentionally
<!-- rule: 13.6 source: wfdf -->

drops the disc, places the disc on the ground, or transfers possession of the disc, they must re-establish
possession and restart play with a check.
### 13.7. After a turnover, the turnover location is where:
<!-- rule: 13.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **13.7.1.** the disc has come to a stop or is picked up by an offensive player; or
        <!-- rule: 13.7.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.7.2.** the intercepting player stops; or
        <!-- rule: 13.7.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.7.3.** the thrower was located at the time of the call, in the case of 13.2.2, 13.2.3, 13.2.4, 13.2.5; or
        <!-- rule: 13.7.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.7.4.** the offensive player was located, in the case of 13.2.6 and 13.2.7; or
        <!-- rule: 13.7.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.7.5.** the accepted offensive receiving foul occurred.
        <!-- rule: 13.7.5 source: wfdf -->
### 13.8. If the turnover location is out-of-bounds, or the disc touched an out-of-bounds area after the turnover
<!-- rule: 13.8 source: wfdf -->

occurred, the thrower must establish a pivot point at the location on the central zone nearest to where
the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.8).
      - **13.8.1.** If 13.8 does not apply, a pivot point must be established according to 13.9, 13.10, or 13.11.
        <!-- rule: 13.8.1 source: wfdf -->
### 13.9. If the turnover location is in the central zone, the thrower must establish a pivot point at that location.
<!-- rule: 13.9 source: wfdf -->

### 13.10. If the turnover location is in the offence’s attacking end zone, the thrower must establish a pivot point
<!-- rule: 13.10 source: wfdf -->

at the nearest location on the goal line.
### 13.11. If the turnover location is in the offence’s defending end zone, the thrower may choose where to
<!-- rule: 13.11 source: wfdf -->

establish a pivot point:
      - **13.11.1.** at the turnover location, by staying at the turnover location or faking a pass; or
        <!-- rule: 13.11.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **13.11.2.** at the nearest location on the goal line to the turnover location, by moving from the turnover
        <!-- rule: 13.11.2 source: wfdf -->
location.
        - **13.11.2.1.** The intended thrower, before picking up the disc, may signal the goal line option by fully
          <!-- rule: 13.11.2.1 source: wfdf -->
extending one arm above their head.
      - **13.11.3.** Immediate movement, staying at the turnover location, faking a pass, or signaling the goal line
        <!-- rule: 13.11.3 source: wfdf -->
option, determines where to establish a pivot point and cannot be reversed.
### 13.12. If, after an accepted turnover, play has continued unknowingly, play stops and the disc is returned to the
<!-- rule: 13.12 source: wfdf -->

turnover location, players resume their positions at the time the turnover occurred and play restarts
with a check.
## 14. Scoring

<!-- section: 14 source: wfdf -->

### 14.1. A goal is scored if an in-bounds player catches a legal pass and:
<!-- rule: 14.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **14.1.1.** all their ground contacts are entirely within their attacking end zone, or for an airborne player, all
        <!-- rule: 14.1.1 source: wfdf -->
of their first simultaneous points of ground contact after catching the disc are entirely within
their attacking end zone, and
      - **14.1.2.** they subsequently establish possession of the disc, and maintain the catch throughout all ground
        <!-- rule: 14.1.2 source: wfdf -->
contact related to the catch (note 12.1, 12.1.1).
### 14.2. If a player believes a goal has been scored, they may call “goal” and play stops. After a contested or
<!-- rule: 14.2 source: wfdf -->

retracted goal call play must restart with a check and the call is deemed to have been made when the
player established possession.

### 14.3. If a player in possession of the disc ends up in the end zone they are attacking without scoring a goal
<!-- rule: 14.3 source: wfdf -->

according to 14.1, the player must establish a pivot point at the nearest location on the goal line.
### 14.4. The time at which a goal is deemed to have been scored is when the player established possession.
<!-- rule: 14.4 source: wfdf -->

## 15. Calling Fouls, Infractions and Violations

<!-- section: 15 source: wfdf -->

### 15.1. A breach of the rules due to non-minor contact between two or more opposing players is a foul.
<!-- rule: 15.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **15.1.1.** A player intentionally initiating minor contact is still a breach of the rules, but is to be treated as a
        <!-- rule: 15.1.1 source: wfdf -->
violation, and not a foul.
### 15.2. A breach of the rules regarding a Marking or Travel breach is an infraction. Infractions do not stop play.
<!-- rule: 15.2 source: wfdf -->

### 15.3. Every other breach of the rules is a violation.
<!-- rule: 15.3 source: wfdf -->

### 15.4. Only the player fouled may claim a foul, by calling “Foul”.
<!-- rule: 15.4 source: wfdf -->

### 15.5. In general only the thrower may claim an infraction, by calling the specific name of the infraction.
<!-- rule: 15.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **15.5.1.** However any offensive player may call a double team, and any defensive player may call a travel
        <!-- rule: 15.5.1 source: wfdf -->
infraction.
### 15.6. Any opposing player may claim a violation, by calling the specific name of the violation or "Violation",
<!-- rule: 15.6 source: wfdf -->

unless specified otherwise by the particular rule.
### 15.7. When a foul or violation call is made that stops play, players must stop play by visibly or audibly
<!-- rule: 15.7 source: wfdf -->

communicating the stoppage as soon as they are aware of the call and all players should echo calls on the
field. If play has stopped for a discussion without any call having been made, a call is deemed to have been
made when the discussion started.
### 15.8. Calls must be made immediately after the breach is recognised.
<!-- rule: 15.8 source: wfdf -->

### 15.9. After a player initiates a stoppage incorrectly, including after mishearing a call, not knowing the rules, or
<!-- rule: 15.9 source: wfdf -->

not making the call immediately:
      - **15.9.1.** if the opposition gains or retains possession, any subsequent play stands.
        <!-- rule: 15.9.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **15.9.2.** if the opposition does not gain or retain possession, the disc must be returned to the last non-
        <!-- rule: 15.9.2 source: wfdf -->
disputed thrower, unless 16.3 applies.
      - **15.9.3.** The stall count resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by the player who initiated the
        <!-- rule: 15.9.3 source: wfdf -->
stoppage incorrectly.
### 15.10. If the player against whom the foul, infraction or violation has been called disagrees that it occurred, or
<!-- rule: 15.10 source: wfdf -->

does not think it is a correct call, they may call “Contest”.
### 15.11. If a player making any call subsequently determines that their call was incorrect, they can retract the
<!-- rule: 15.11 source: wfdf -->

call, by calling "Retracted". Play resumes as if an accepted breach has been caused by that player.
### 15.12. If multiple breaches occur on the same play or before play stops, the outcomes should be resolved in
<!-- rule: 15.12 source: wfdf -->

reverse sequence (latest breach first, earliest breach last).
### 15.13. Players are encouraged to use the WFDF Hand Signals to communicate all calls.
<!-- rule: 15.13 source: wfdf -->

## 16. Continuation after a Call

<!-- section: 16 source: wfdf -->

### 16.1. Whenever a foul or violation call is made, or a player attempts to stop play in any way, play stops
<!-- rule: 16.1 source: wfdf -->

immediately and no turnover is possible (unless in situations specified in 15.9, 16.2, and 16.3).
### 16.2. If a foul or violation:
<!-- rule: 16.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **16.2.1.** is called against the thrower and the thrower attempts a pass, or
        <!-- rule: 16.2.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.2.2.** is called by the thrower during the act of throwing, or
        <!-- rule: 16.2.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.2.3.** is called or occurs when the disc is in the air,
        <!-- rule: 16.2.3 source: wfdf -->
then play continues until possession has been established.
      - **16.2.4.** Once possession has been established:
        <!-- rule: 16.2.4 source: wfdf -->
        - **16.2.4.1.** If the team that called the foul or violation gains or retains possession as a result of the
          <!-- rule: 16.2.4.1 source: wfdf -->
pass, the play stands. Play can continue without a stoppage if the player who made the foul
or violation call makes a “Play on” call as soon as possible.
        - **16.2.4.2.** If the team that called the foul or violation does not gain or retain possession as a result of
          <!-- rule: 16.2.4.2 source: wfdf -->
the pass, play must be stopped.

          - **16.2.4.2.1.** If the team that called the foul or violation believes that possession has been affected by
            <!-- rule: 16.2.4.2.1 source: wfdf -->
the foul or violation, the disc will be returned to the thrower for a check (unless the
specific rule says otherwise).
### 16.3. Regardless of when any call is made, if the players involved from both teams agree that the event or call
<!-- rule: 16.3 source: wfdf -->

did not affect the outcome, the play stands. This rule is not superseded by any other rule.
      - **16.3.1.** If the play resulted in a goal, the goal stands.
        <!-- rule: 16.3.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **16.3.2.** If the play did not result in a goal the affected players may make up any positional disadvantage
        <!-- rule: 16.3.2 source: wfdf -->
caused by the event or call and restart play with a check.
## 17. Fouls

<!-- section: 17 source: wfdf -->

### 17.1. Dangerous Play:
<!-- rule: 17.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.1.1.** Actions demonstrating reckless disregard for the safety of fellow players, or posing significant risk
        <!-- rule: 17.1.1 source: wfdf -->
of injury to fellow players, or other dangerously aggressive behaviours, are considered dangerous
play and must be treated as a foul, regardless of whether or when contact occurs. This rule is not
superseded by any other foul rule. If the dangerous play call is accepted, this must be treated as
the most relevant foul from Section 17.
### 17.2. Receiving Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.2.1.** A Receiving Foul occurs when a player initiates non-minor contact with an opponent before,
        <!-- rule: 17.2.1 source: wfdf -->
while, or directly after, either player makes a play on the disc.
        - **17.2.1.1.** Contact with an opponent’s arms or hands, that occurs after the disc has been caught, or
          <!-- rule: 17.2.1.1 source: wfdf -->
after the opponent can no longer make a play on the disc, is not a sufficient basis for a foul,
but should be avoided (excluding contact related to Section 17.1 and 17.3).
      - **17.2.2.** After an accepted receiving foul the fouled player gains possession at the location of the breach,
        <!-- rule: 17.2.2 source: wfdf -->
even if that location is in an end zone, and play restarts with a check. If, after the check, 14.3
applies, the stall count can not be started until a pivot point is established at the nearest location
on the goal line. If the foul is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower.
### 17.3. Strip Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.3.1.** A Strip Foul occurs when an opponent fouls a player and that causes the player to drop a disc
        <!-- rule: 17.3.1 source: wfdf -->
they caught or to lose possession of the disc.
      - **17.3.2.** If the reception would have otherwise been a goal, and the foul is accepted, a goal is awarded.
        <!-- rule: 17.3.2 source: wfdf -->
### 17.4. Blocking Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.4 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.4.1.** A Blocking Foul occurs when a player takes a position that an opponent moving in a legal manner
        <!-- rule: 17.4.1 source: wfdf -->
will be unable to avoid, taking into account the opponents expected position based on their
established speed and direction, and non-minor contact results. This is to be treated as either a
receiving foul or an indirect foul, whichever is applicable.
### 17.5. Force-out Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.5 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.5.1.** A Force-out Foul occurs when a receiver is in the process of establishing possession of the disc,
        <!-- rule: 17.5.1 source: wfdf -->
and is fouled by a defensive player before subsequently establishing possession, and the contact
caused the receiver:
        - **17.5.1.1.** to catch the disc out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds; or
          <!-- rule: 17.5.1.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **17.5.1.2.** to catch the disc in the central zone instead of their attacking end zone.
          <!-- rule: 17.5.1.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **17.5.2.** If the receiver would have caught the disc in their attacking end zone, it is a goal;
        <!-- rule: 17.5.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **17.5.3.** If the force-out foul is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower if the receiver became out-
        <!-- rule: 17.5.3 source: wfdf -->
of-bounds, otherwise the disc stays with the receiver.
### 17.6. Defensive Throwing (Marking) Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.6 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.6.1.** A Defensive Throwing Foul occurs when:
        <!-- rule: 17.6.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **17.6.1.1.** There is non-minor contact between the thrower and an illegally positioned defensive
          <!-- rule: 17.6.1.1 source: wfdf -->
player (Section 18.1); or
        - **17.6.1.2.** A defensive player initiates non-minor contact with the thrower, or there is non-minor
          <!-- rule: 17.6.1.2 source: wfdf -->
contact resulting from the thrower and the defender both vying for the same unoccupied
position, prior to the thrower releasing the pass.
        - **17.6.1.3.** If a Defensive Throwing Foul occurs prior to the thrower releasing the pass and not during
          <!-- rule: 17.6.1.3 source: wfdf -->
the throwing motion, the thrower may choose to call a contact infraction, by calling

“Contact”. After a contact infraction that is not contested, play does not stop and the
marker must resume the stall count at one (1).
### 17.7. Offensive Throwing (Thrower) Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.7 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.7.1.** An Offensive Throwing Foul occurs when the thrower is solely responsible for initiating non-
        <!-- rule: 17.7.1 source: wfdf -->
minor contact with a defensive player who is in a legal position.
      - **17.7.2.** Contact occurring during the thrower's follow through is not a sufficient basis for a foul, but
        <!-- rule: 17.7.2 source: wfdf -->
should be avoided.
### 17.8. Indirect Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.8 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.8.1.** An Indirect Foul occurs when there is non-minor contact between a receiver and a defensive
        <!-- rule: 17.8.1 source: wfdf -->
player that does not directly affect an attempt to make a play on the disc.
        - **17.8.1.1.** Prior to making the "Indirect Foul" call, the player may delay the call up to two (2) seconds
          <!-- rule: 17.8.1.1 source: wfdf -->
to determine if the breach will affect the play.
      - **17.8.2.** If the foul is accepted the fouled player may make up any positional disadvantage caused by the
        <!-- rule: 17.8.2 source: wfdf -->
foul.
### 17.9. Offsetting Fouls:
<!-- rule: 17.9 source: wfdf -->

      - **17.9.1.** If accepted fouls are called by offensive and defensive players on the same play, these are
        <!-- rule: 17.9.1 source: wfdf -->
offsetting fouls, and the disc must be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
      - **17.9.2.** If there is non-minor contact that is caused by two or more opposing players moving towards a
        <!-- rule: 17.9.2 source: wfdf -->
single point simultaneously, this must be treated as offsetting fouls.
        - **17.9.2.1.** However if this occurs after the disc has been caught, or after the relevant player/s
          <!-- rule: 17.9.2.1 source: wfdf -->
involved can no longer make a play on the disc, this must be treated as an Indirect Foul
(excluding contact related to Section 17.1).
## 18. Infractions and Violations

<!-- section: 18 source: wfdf -->

### 18.1. Marking Infractions:
<!-- rule: 18.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **18.1.1.** Marking infractions include the following:
        <!-- rule: 18.1.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.1.1.** “Fast Count” – the marker:
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.1.1.1.1.** starts or continues the stall count illegally,
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1.1 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.1.1.1.2.** does not start or restart the stall count with “Stalling”,
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1.2 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.1.1.1.3.** counts in less than one second intervals,
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1.3 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.1.1.1.4.** does not correctly reduce or reset the stall count when required, or
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1.4 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.1.1.1.5.** does not start the stall count from the correct number.
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.1.5 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.1.2.** “Straddle” – a line between a defensive player’s feet comes within one disc diameter of the
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.2 source: wfdf -->
thrower’s pivot point.
        - **18.1.1.3.** “Disc Space” – any part of a defensive player is less than one disc diameter away from the
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.3 source: wfdf -->
torso of the thrower. However, if this situation is caused solely by movement of the
thrower, it is not an infraction.
        - **18.1.1.4.** “Wrapping” – a line between a defensive player’s hands or arms comes within one disc
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.4 source: wfdf -->
diameter of the thrower’s torso, or any part of the defensive player’s body is above the
thrower’s pivot point. However, if this situation is caused solely by movement of the
thrower, it is not an infraction.
        - **18.1.1.5.** "Double Team" – a defensive player other than the marker is within three (3) metres of the
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.5 source: wfdf -->
thrower's pivot point without also guarding another offensive player.
          - **18.1.1.5.1.** The defender guarding another offensive player can attempt to prevent a pass from
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.5.1 source: wfdf -->
the thrower, as long as they continue to guard another offensive player.
          - **18.1.1.5.2.** Merely running across this area is not a double team.
            <!-- rule: 18.1.1.5.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.1.6.** “Vision” – a defensive player uses any part of their body to intentionally obstruct the
          <!-- rule: 18.1.1.6 source: wfdf -->
thrower’s vision.
      - **18.1.2.** A marking infraction may be contested by the defence, in which case play stops.
        <!-- rule: 18.1.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.2.1.** If a pass has been completed, a contested or retracted marking infraction must be treated
          <!-- rule: 18.1.2.1 source: wfdf -->
as a violation by the offence, and the disc must be returned to the thrower.
      - **18.1.3.** After all marking infractions listed in 18.1.1 and where play has not stopped, the marker must
        <!-- rule: 18.1.3 source: wfdf -->
resume the stall count with the number last fully uttered before the call, minus one (1).

        - **18.1.3.1.** 
          <!-- rule: 18.1.3.1 source: wfdf -->
The marker must not resume counting until any illegal positioning has been corrected. To
do otherwise is a subsequent marking infraction.
      - **18.1.4.** Instead of calling a marking infraction, the relevant player may call a marking violation and stop
        <!-- rule: 18.1.4 source: wfdf -->
play if;
        - **18.1.4.1.** the stall count is not corrected,
          <!-- rule: 18.1.4.1 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.4.2.** there is no stall count,
          <!-- rule: 18.1.4.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.4.3.** there is an egregious marking infraction, or
          <!-- rule: 18.1.4.3 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.1.4.4.** there is a pattern of repeated marking infractions.
          <!-- rule: 18.1.4.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **18.1.5.** If a marking infraction, or a marking violation, is called and the thrower also attempts a pass
        <!-- rule: 18.1.5 source: wfdf -->
before, during or after the call, the call has no consequences (unless 18.1.2.1 applies) and if the
pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands.
### 18.2. “Travel” Infractions:
<!-- rule: 18.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **18.2.1.** After catching the disc, the thrower must reduce speed as quickly as possible, without changing
        <!-- rule: 18.2.1 source: wfdf -->
direction, until they have established a pivot point.
        - **18.2.1.1.** However if a player catches the disc while running or jumping the player may release a pass
          <!-- rule: 18.2.1.1 source: wfdf -->
without attempting to reduce speed and without establishing a pivot point, provided that:
          - **18.2.1.1.1.** they do not change direction or increase speed until they release the pass; and
            <!-- rule: 18.2.1.1.1 source: wfdf -->
          - **18.2.1.1.2.** a maximum of two additional points of contact with the ground are made after the catch
            <!-- rule: 18.2.1.1.2 source: wfdf -->
and before they release the pass.
      - **18.2.2.** The thrower may move in any direction (pivot) only by establishing and maintaining a pivot point
        <!-- rule: 18.2.2 source: wfdf -->
until releasing a pass.
      - **18.2.3.** A thrower who is not standing can use any part of their body as the pivot point.
        <!-- rule: 18.2.3 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.2.3.1.** If they stand up it is not a travel, but only if a pivot point is established at the same location.
          <!-- rule: 18.2.3.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **18.2.4.** A travel infraction occurs if:
        <!-- rule: 18.2.4 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.2.4.1.** the thrower establishes a pivot point at an incorrect location, including by not reducing
          <!-- rule: 18.2.4.1 source: wfdf -->
speed as quickly as possible after a catch, or changing direction after a catch;
        - **18.2.4.2.** the thrower releases a pass in breach of 18.2.1.1;
          <!-- rule: 18.2.4.2 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.2.4.3.** anytime the thrower must move to a specified location, the thrower does not establish a
          <!-- rule: 18.2.4.3 source: wfdf -->
pivot point before a wind-up or throwing motion begins;
        - **18.2.4.4.** the thrower fails to keep the established pivot point until releasing a pass;
          <!-- rule: 18.2.4.4 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.2.4.5.** a player intentionally bobbles, fumbles or delays the disc to themselves, for the sole
          <!-- rule: 18.2.4.5 source: wfdf -->
purpose of moving in a specific direction.
      - **18.2.5.** After an accepted travel infraction is called (“travel”), play does not stop.
        <!-- rule: 18.2.5 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.2.5.1.** The thrower establishes a pivot point at the correct location, as indicated by the player
          <!-- rule: 18.2.5.1 source: wfdf -->
who called the travel. This must occur without delay from either player involved.
        - **18.2.5.2.** Any stall count is paused, and the thrower may not throw the disc, until a pivot point is
          <!-- rule: 18.2.5.2 source: wfdf -->
established at the correct location.
        - **18.2.5.3.** The marker does not need to say “Stalling” before resuming the stall count.
          <!-- rule: 18.2.5.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **18.2.6.** If, after a travel infraction but before correcting the pivot point, the thrower throws a completed
        <!-- rule: 18.2.6 source: wfdf -->
pass, the defensive team may call a travel violation. Play stops and the disc is returned to the
thrower. The thrower must return to the location occupied at the time of the infraction. Play
must restart with a check.
      - **18.2.7.** If, after a travel infraction, the thrower throws an incomplete pass, play continues.
        <!-- rule: 18.2.7 source: wfdf -->
      - **18.2.8.** After a contested travel infraction where the thrower has not released a pass, play stops.
        <!-- rule: 18.2.8 source: wfdf -->
### 18.3. “Pick” Violations:
<!-- rule: 18.3 source: wfdf -->

      - **18.3.1.** If a defensive player is guarding one offensive player and they are prevented from moving
        <!-- rule: 18.3.1 source: wfdf -->
towards/with that player by another player, that defensive player may call “Pick”. However it is
not a pick if both the player being guarded and the obstructing player are making a play on the
disc at the time of the obstruction.
        - **18.3.1.1.** Prior to making the "Pick" call, the defender may delay the call up to two (2) seconds to
          <!-- rule: 18.3.1.1 source: wfdf -->
determine if the obstruction will affect the play.
      - **18.3.2.** If play has stopped, the obstructed player may move to the agreed position they would have
        <!-- rule: 18.3.2 source: wfdf -->
otherwise occupied if the obstruction had not occurred, unless specified otherwise.
      - **18.3.3.** All players should take reasonable efforts to avoid the occurrence of picks.
        <!-- rule: 18.3.3 source: wfdf -->
        - **18.3.3.1.** During any stoppage opposing players may agree to slightly adjust their locations to avoid
          <!-- rule: 18.3.3.1 source: wfdf -->
potential picks.

## 19. Safety Stoppages

<!-- section: 19 source: wfdf -->

### 19.1. Injury Stoppage
<!-- rule: 19.1 source: wfdf -->

      - **19.1.1.** An injury stoppage, “Injury”, may be called by the injured player, or by any player on the injured
        <!-- rule: 19.1.1 source: wfdf -->
player’s team.
      - **19.1.2.** If the injury was not caused by an opponent, the player must choose either to be substituted, or
        <!-- rule: 19.1.2 source: wfdf -->
to charge their own team with a time-out.
      - **19.1.3.** If the injury was caused by an opponent, the player may choose to stay or to be substituted.
        <!-- rule: 19.1.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **19.1.4.** If the injured player had established possession of the disc, and the player has dropped the disc
        <!-- rule: 19.1.4 source: wfdf -->
due to the injury, that player retains possession of the disc.
      - **19.1.5.** The injury stoppage is considered to have been called at the time of the injury, unless the injured
        <!-- rule: 19.1.5 source: wfdf -->
player chooses to continue play before the stoppage is called.
      - **19.1.6.** If the disc was in the air when the injury stoppage was called, play continues until either a player
        <!-- rule: 19.1.6 source: wfdf -->
establishes possession, or the disc hits the ground. If the injury is not the result of a foul by an
opponent, the completion or turnover stands, and play restarts there after the stoppage.
### 19.2. Technical Stoppage
<!-- rule: 19.2 source: wfdf -->

      - **19.2.1.** Any player who recognises a condition that endangers players, including if a player has an open or
        <!-- rule: 19.2.1 source: wfdf -->
bleeding wound, should call a technical stoppage by calling “technical” or “stop”. Play must stop
immediately.
        - **19.2.1.1.** A team-mate, coach, or designated official, should actively alert players to any condition
          <!-- rule: 19.2.1.1 source: wfdf -->
that endangers players.
        - **19.2.1.2.** A player who has an issue regarding an open or bleeding wound has seventy (70) seconds
          <!-- rule: 19.2.1.2 source: wfdf -->
to effectively address the issue. If they need additional time to address the issue, they must
choose either to be substituted, or to charge their own team with a time-out.
      - **19.2.2.** The thrower may call a technical stoppage during play to replace a severely damaged disc.
        <!-- rule: 19.2.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **19.2.3.** After a technical stoppage called while the disc is in the air, or if play has continued unknowingly:
        <!-- rule: 19.2.3 source: wfdf -->
        - **19.2.3.1.** If the call or issue did not affect play, the completion or turnover stands, and play restarts
          <!-- rule: 19.2.3.1 source: wfdf -->
there;
        - **19.2.3.2.** If the call or issue did affect the play, the disc goes back to the thrower.
          <!-- rule: 19.2.3.2 source: wfdf -->
### 19.3. If a player is substituted after an injury, or due to illegal or faulty equipment, the opposing team may also
<!-- rule: 19.3 source: wfdf -->

choose to substitute one player.
      - **19.3.1.** Substitute players take on the full state (location, possession, stall count etc) of the player they
        <!-- rule: 19.3.1 source: wfdf -->
are substituting and may make a call on their behalf.
## 20. Time-Outs

<!-- section: 20 source: wfdf -->

### 20.1. The player calling a time-out must form a "T" with their hands, or with one hand and the disc, and should
<!-- rule: 20.1 source: wfdf -->

call "time-out" to opposition players.
### 20.2. After the start of a point and before both teams have signalled readiness, a player from either team may
<!-- rule: 20.2 source: wfdf -->

call a time-out. The time-out extends the time between the start of the point and subsequent pull by
seventy-five (75) seconds.
### 20.3. After the pull only a thrower with possession of the disc may call a time-out. The time-out starts when
<!-- rule: 20.3 source: wfdf -->

the “T” is formed, and lasts seventy-five (75) seconds. After such a time-out:
      - **20.3.1.** Substitutions are not allowed, except for injury.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.1 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.2.** Play is restarted at the pivot location.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.2 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.3.** The thrower must remain the same.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.3 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.4.** All other offensive players must establish a stationary position, at any location.
        <!-- rule: 20.3.4 source: wfdf -->
      - **20.3.5.** Once the offensive players have selected positions, defensive players must then establish a
        <!-- rule: 20.3.5 source: wfdf -->
stationary position, at any location.
      - **20.3.6.** The stall count restarts at maximum nine (9). However if the marker has been switched, the stall
        <!-- rule: 20.3.6 source: wfdf -->
count restarts at “Stalling one (1)”.
### 20.4. If the thrower attempts to call a time-out while play is live and when their team has no remaining time-
<!-- rule: 20.4 source: wfdf -->

outs, play is stopped. The marker must add two (2) seconds to the stall count they would have restarted
play on before restarting play with a check. If this results in a stall count of ten (10) or above, this is a
"stall-out" turnover.

## Definitions

<!-- section: definitions source: wfdf -->

Act of throwing
See throwing motion.
Affect the play
A breach or call affects the play if it is reasonable to assume that the
outcome of the specific play may have been meaningfully different had the
breach or call not occurred.
Attacking end zone The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to score.
Best perspective
The most complete viewpoint available by a player that includes the relative
position of the disc, ground, players and line markers involved in the play.
Call
A clearly communicated statement that a foul, infraction, violation, turnover
or injury has occurred. The following terms may be used: Foul, Travel,
specific name of Marking Infraction, Violation (or specific name of Violation),
specific name of turnovers, Technical, and Injury.
Catch
A non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts.
If a player initially catches a pass and then, prior to establishing possession,
they do not maintain the catch (‘maintain the catch’ means to continue to
have a non-spinning disc trapped between at least two body parts), that
initial catch is deemed to have ended.
Central zone
The area of the playing field including the goal lines but excluding the end
zones and the perimeter lines.
Defending end zone The end zone in which the team in question is currently attempting to
prevent the opposition from scoring.
Defensive player
Any player whose team is not in possession of the disc.
End zone
One of the two areas at the end of the playing field where teams can score a
goal by catching the disc there.
Goal line
The line separating the central zone from each end zone. It is not part of the
end zone
Ground
The ground consists of all substantial solid objects, including grass, marker
cones, equipment, water, trees, fences, walls and non-players, but excluding
all players and their worn clothing, airborne particles and precipitation.
Ground contact
Refers to all player contact with the ground directly related to a specific
event or manoeuvre, including landing or recovery after being off-balance
(e.g., jumping, diving, leaning, or falling).
Guarding
A defender is guarding an offensive player when they are within three metres
of that offensive player and are primarily focused on and reacting to that
offensive player.
Interception
When a player on the defensive team establishes possession of a throw by a
player on the offensive team.
Legitimate position The stationary or moving position established by a player that is not in
breach of any rules.
Line
A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is
defined as an imaginary line between two field markers with the thickness of
said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining
markers.
Making a play on the
disc
When the disc is in the air and a player is attempting to make contact with
the disc in any way e.g. to catch it or block it. This includes the process of
running towards the place they expect to make contact with the disc.
Marker
The defensive player who may call the stall count on the thrower.
Minor contact
Contact that involves minimal physical force and does not alter the
movements or position of another player.
Contact with an opponent’s extended arms or hands that are about to, or
already are, contacting the disc, or contact to the throwers hand during the
throwing motion, is not considered to be minor contact.
Non-player
Any person, including a team member, who is not currently a player.
Offensive player
A player whose team is in possession of the disc.
Out-of-bounds (OB) Everything that is not part of the playing field, including the perimeter lines.

Perimeter lines
Lines separating the central zone or end zone from the out-of-bounds area.
They are not part of the playing field.
Pivot
When the thrower moves in any direction while keeping one part of their
body in constant contact with a specific point on the ground called the pivot
point.
A thrower establishes a pivot point by placing, or keeping, a particular part
of their body at a specific point, which they intend to use as their pivot point.
If a thrower has multiple options for a pivot point, the pivot point is not
determined until they pivot.
Pivot Location
The point on the playing field where the thrower is required to establish a
pivot point after a turnover, after the pull, after a time-out, after leaving the
central zone, or where a pivot point has already been established.
Play

The time after the Pull has commenced and prior to the scoring of a goal.
Play may further stop due to a call, in which case play is restarted with a
check.
Player
The people who are actually participating in the current point of play.
Playing Field
The area including the central zone and the end zones, but excluding the
perimeter lines.
Possession of the
disc
A player establishes possession of a pass when:
-
they catch a pass and then they maintain that catch for more than one
noticeable instant, and
-
they maintain the catch throughout all ground contact related to the
catch, or until they throw the disc
A player can also establish possession when a disc that has already hit the
ground is picked up, or is given to them, after a turnover, pull, or stoppage.
Once a player has established possession, they may change their grip on the
disc and that does not affect their possession, as long as they maintain
contact with the disc.
A disc in the possession of a player, or caught by a player, is considered part
of that player.
The team whose player is in possession or whose players may pick up the
disc is considered the team in possession.
Pre-stall
A warning regarding time limits to resume play, issued by giving warnings at
twenty (20), ten (10), and five (5) seconds (as applicable).
Pull
The throw by the defence to the offence that starts play at the beginning of a
half or after a goal. The pull is not considered a legal pass.
Receivers
All offensive players other than the thrower.
Spirit Stoppage
A stoppage to discuss issues related to Spirit of the Game.
Stoppage of play
Any halting of play due to a foul, violation, discussion, contested call, injury
or time-out, that requires a check to restart play.
Throw
A disc in flight following any throwing motion, including after a fake attempt
and an intentionally dropped disc, that results in loss of contact between the
thrower and the disc.
A pass is the equivalent of a throw.
Thrower
The offensive player in possession of the disc, or the player who has just
thrown the disc prior to when the result of the throw has been determined.
Throwing motion
The throwing motion is the motion that transfers momentum from the
thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots
and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
Turnover
Any event resulting in a change of the team in possession. A turnover is not
considered a violation.
Where the disc
stops
Refers to the location where a player establishes possession, the disc comes
to rest naturally, or where the disc is stopped from rolling or sliding.
